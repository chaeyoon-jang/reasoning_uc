This doesn't change the distance from the starting point, but it moves A eastward.\n\nNext, A travels 3 km to the north, which means A is now 0 km away from the starting point (since it cancels out the previous southward movement).\n\nFinally, A travels 2 km to the west. Since it travels 5 km eastward and then 2 km to the west, it means A is 5 - 2 = 3 km east of the starting point.\n\nTo find the distance from the starting point, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the legs of the right triangle (the eastward and northward distances), and c is the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance from the starting point).\n\nIn this case, a = 3 km (eastward) and b = 3 km (northward). So, c^2 = 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides: c = sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.24 km.\n\nHowever, since the answer choices are not decimals, we need to check if any of the answer choices are multiples of 3 (or 4.24 divided by 3, to find a matching whole number). Answer choice (D) is 5, which is not a multiple of 3. Now take the answer 3*sqrt(2), and square it to get 3^2*(sqrt(2))^2, which is 3^2*2. 9*2 is 18, which we already did before. Keep looking to see if there is any other possible solution; we see that 4 is 2*2, which is 4^2. A 2 squared equals 4, so 3*4 is 12, which we could use with the Pythagorean theorem: \n sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25",

A travels 3 km north: This cancels out the initial 3 km they were south of home, so now A is 0 km away from home in terms of north-south distance.\n4. A travels 2 km west: This moves A 2 km west of their original east-west position, but since they were already 5 km east, they are now 3 km west of home.\n\nIn summary, A is 3 km west and 0 km north of home, which forms a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 km (east-west) and 0 km (north-south).

Now we have a net north position after the 3 south movement that offset with the final 3 km north.\n4. Finally, A travels 2 km west, which cancels out 2 km of its 3 km east movement.\n\nThus, A ends up 1 km north from its starting point and 1 km east from its initial southern location. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem (equivalent to Pythagoras' Theorem, Pythagorean) to determine how far A is from the point where they started. The theorem has two parts:\n\n a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nHere a=1km and b=1km, thus we can plug both values in:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n1^2 + 1^2 = c^2\n1+1=c^2\n2=c^2\n\nThis can be solved for c:\n c = √2. \n We can think of this geometrically: using a =1b=1km on a Pythagorean street layout: one of the sides have length 1 and thus its height will be √2. \n\nSince this results are easily recognizable, we can consider it incorrect to use the “Euclidian square” formula as an estimator. Using the coordinates with mathematical derivations, the function c can therefore simply be seen as ≈1.414 or sqrt(2), “3 square units” distance from the “home” i.e the “starting” coordinate since using Cartesian coordinates only makes the understanding not purely instinctual while comparing “definitely considerable",
