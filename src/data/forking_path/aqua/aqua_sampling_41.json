Since points B, C, and D are on the circle, and you know that the measures of angles that intercept minor arcs add up to 360°, and that of angles that intercept arcs that the same measure of arc add up to 180°, you can solve this as follows: minor arc AD + 2 · minor arc BD = 180° 2 · 150° + minor arc AD = 180° 300° + minor arc AD = 180° minor arc AD = 180° – 300° =  -120° However, the minor arc measure can't be negative; therefore, the placement of the points on the circle was incorrect. Therefore, you should look again at where points C and D lie on the circle, then repeat the calculation. Consider the circle as follows: Points A, C, D lie on the circumference, and the measure of minor arc AC is 160°. Minor arc CD must be equal to 360° – 160° = 200° because an inscribed angle and an arc between the same points on a circle intercepting the same arcs intercept equal arc measures.

The calculation is as follows: minor arc AD + 2 · minor arc BD = 180° minor arc AD + 2 · 150° = 180° minor arc AD = 180° – 300° =  -120° However, the minor arc measure can't be negative. Points B, C, D, must be placed in a different order on the circle such that minor arc CD and minor arc AB measure between 0° and 180°. Since angle AOC is an inscribed angle in a circle, and arc AC = 160°, the angle AOC = 160° / 2 = 80°. Points C and D should be placed on the circle such that the angle AOC and the arc AB share a point at point C.

This makes the measure of the arc AD, by definition of a full 360 degrees, (180 degrees) + (160 degrees), which is equal to 340 degrees. Since the minor arc AC and the minor arc BD each measure 150 degrees and they each meet at point B, the measure of the minor arc AB is 150 degrees. To get the measure of the minor arc BD, you must add that to the measure of the minor arc CD, which is 150 degrees. The measure of the minor arc AD equals 340 degrees minus the measure of the minor arc AB. By substituting, we get the measure of minor arc AD as (340 degrees) - (150 degrees), which equals 190 degrees. But that is not an answer choice, so you need to re-evaluate the problem and reconsider where the measure of the minor arc AD lies. As described above, angle ABD is equal to (1/2) arc AC. Since minor arc AC has a measure of 160 degrees, minor arc AB must have a measure of (1/2)(160 degrees), or 80 degrees. You are also told that B bisects minor arc AC, and that this is true for arc AC and arc BD as well. The question provides the diagram, showing both arcs AC and BD each being divided by line AB, which includes point B. In other words, point B bisects arcs AC and BD. The remaining portion of the circle consists of minor arc AD and minor arc BD. The minor arcs BD and AC together contain a portion of the circle with a measure of (150 degrees) + (160 degrees), or 310 degrees. Because the sum of a circle is 360 degrees, this represents a quarter of the circle. A quarter of a circle is 90 degrees. The combined measure of arcs AD and BD is, therefore, (360 degrees) - (90 degrees), or 270 degrees. Minor arc AD must be half the measure of the combined arcs AD and BD, which, as stated above, is 360 - (270 degrees), or 90 degrees. However, that is not an answer choice.

Minor arc AD also includes arc BD and it is therefore greater than minor arc AC because arc AD is directly across from angle B, and arcs adjacent to the inscribed angle B will add up to at least 180°.

However, the question states that the measure of minor arc AD is at least 180°, and since it can't be more than a straight line, then minor arc AD must be 210°, which means that the value of minor arc AD must be more than 180° and can’t be 155°, since it would eliminate the other arcs.

            " minor arc it cuts. For angle BAD, m follows this relationship: m angle BAD = (1/2) m minor arc AD. Let x be the measure of minor arc AD. So m angle BAD = (1/2) x. Given the above definition for angle BAD, we know that m angle ABC = (1/2) m minor arc BC = (1/2) ( x + 160 degrees), or 80 + (1/2) x. Now look at angles BAD and ABC. They cut off the same arc BD. By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, they have the same measure. This means 80 + (1/2) x = (1/2) x. In this equation, x has to cancel out, meaning the coefficients of x on each side have to be the same: 80 degrees = 0. If this were true, the inscribed angle Theorem would be violated, and we would have an equation of a different sort. Divide both sides by 1/2, and you'll see that this doesn't work. It's much simpler to look at what m minor arc AD is by adding the measures of minor arcs AC and BD instead. Notice, though, that they are supplementary because of the way they are arranged. In a circle, the sum of the measures of the two parts of a sector must be 360°. This means that arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360°. The missing piece of the diagram is inscribed angle ABD, though, and you can figure it out as follows: The minor arcs ABD and BCD together must be less than 180° because they come before angle ABD. Their measure must be less than 180°, which means their sum is less than 180°. As m arc BD is 150°, m arc AB must be (180 - 150), or 30°, because angle BAD + arc AB + arc BD must equal 180°. Now that you have measures for m arc AB and m arc BD, you can find m arc AD. m arc AD = m arc AC + m arc BD = 160 + 150, or 310 degrees. To answer the question, it follows that m arc AD = (D).",

The angle at the center subtending the same arc is 2 × 160, or 320°. The angle BOC is a central angle that cuts arc BD, so the arc AB is half as long as angle BOC, or (320 ÷ 2), or 160. So, B bisects AC. Since B bisects AC, the measure of AB must be 160. The angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc BD, so the measure of angle BCD is half the length of the arc. So the angle is 150/2, or 75. Now add 75 and 160: 75 + 160 = 235. Because 235° is not an option, angle BCD must be an inscribed angle that cuts an arc other than AC or BD. Either angle EDC or angle EAB, whichever is larger, must also cut the same arc that angle BCD cuts. So the measure of the measure of the remaining arc, or the measure of angle EDC, must be 2 × 235, or 470.

We have a straight line and are dealing with two inscribed angles that form a straight line. Therefore, the two angles must be congruent, and each measures half the measure of the intercepted arc.

Since the two base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, angles  ABD  and  CBD  must each be equal to 75°. Therefore, angle  BDC  = 180 – 75 – 75 = 30°. Thus,  ∠ABC  = 180 – 30 – 80 = 70°. Since the inscribed angle  ACD  is half the measure of arc  AD ,  m • ACD  = ½ × 160 = 80°. Therefore,  m  •  ACD  =  m  • ABC  → 80 = 70.

            " intercepted arc. So, the measure of angle ABD will be equal to 80°. Now if we look at major arc BC, we'll see that it measures 130°, since arc AC is 160° and angle B is half that, as previously mentioned. Since angle BAD is half of major arc BC, it measures 65°, as we mentioned before. Then arc AD measures 130° because arc ABD and arc AD together measure 100°. However, this is not an option, so we can continue. If we add together the measures of the minor arcs AC and BD we get 310°. We'll still have the problem that the measure of angle BAD does not match the measure of the arc AD (where the measure of the arc is bigger than the measure of the angle). To solve for arc AD, if we look at the whole circle and look at minor arc BC we'll see that its measure is equal to the measure of minor arc DC. Therefore the measure of arc AD must be 120° since 130 + 120 = 250, which is half of 500, and we know that arc AC is 160 and minor arc AD plus arc DC is half of the whole circle, which equals 360. So, we get 160 + AD = 360, so AD must equal 200. This is not one of the answer choices, so we'll keep going. Then if we add together the measures of the minor arcs AC and BD we get 310. We still have the problem that the measure of angle BAD is not equal to the measure of the arc AD. Since arc AC measures 160 and arc BD measures 150, we will combine arc AC and BD to make a new arc EF and divide arc EF into four equal parts, then arc AE will have the same measure as arc BD (75°), and the measure of arc BF will have the same measure as arc AC (80°). These two angles are two angles of the angle EFB. We now look at the total measure of major arc BC (130°) and half of that (65°), and half of 130, so angle BED is equal to 65°. So arc EF must be equal to 360 - 130 (for arc BC), which is 230. Then since arc AE measures 75° and arc BF measures 80°,",

Now, if angle C and angle D both intercept the same arc (which would be AC and BD, respectively), then the measure of arc AC is equal to the measure of arc BD. Because arc AC is 160° and arc BD is 150°, we can say the measure of arc AB must be 10°. If minor arc AC is bisected by arc BD, that means arc BD splits arc AC into two equal pieces, meaning arc CD must equal the measure of arc AC. To find the measure of arc CD, you would divide the measure of arc AC by 2: 160 over 2 equals 80. Now, the measure of arc AB is 10 and the measure of arc CD is 80, which means the measure of arc AD is the measure of arc AC plus the measure of arc AB, or 160 plus 10, which is 170.Choice A is incorrect and may result from calculation error.

It's given that the measure of arc AC is 160 degrees, so angle B has a measure of half that, or 80 degrees. Since angle B is one-half the measure of arc AD, then arc AD has twice the measure of angle B, which is 2(80) = 160 degrees. Choices (B) and (D) are therefore incorrect. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it cuts. In this case, angle C is an inscribed angle, and it cuts the minor arc BD. Arc BD is 150 degrees. Since arc BD is greater than 180 degrees, then arc CD must be greater than 180 degrees as well. It must therefore be the case that arc AD is the larger of the two, and that angle C cuts arc BD and arc CD. So angle C is half the measure of arc CD, or half the measure of arc AD. The sum of the measures of arc AC and arc AD is 160 degrees plus the measure of arc AD. The measure of arc AD is what we're looking for, so if we know the measure of arc AC and the sum of arc AC and arc AD, we can figure out the measure of arc AD: Arc AC + Arc AD = 160 + x  Since the measure of arc AD is twice the measure of angle C and the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc CD, then arc AD is twice the measure of angle C. Angle C has a measure equal to half the measure of arc CD, so arc AD is twice that, which is 2 9{x}, or 2{x}. Therefore, we can write the equation: 160 + 2{x} = total of arc AC and arc AD The total of arc AC and arc AD is 360 degrees because all arcs around the circumference of a circle add up to 360 degrees. So, 160 + 2{x} = 360 Now, we can solve for x: 2{x} = 360 - 160, 2{x} = 200, and x = 100 Since arc AD has twice the measure of angle C and angle C has twice the measure of arc CD, and",

Likewise, since arc BD is 150°, then the measure of inscribed angle ABD is 150° ÷ 2 = 75°. Angle ABD and angle BCA are alternate interior angles, and the sum of the measures of angles in a triangle is 180°. So, 80° + 75° + BCA = 180°, or BCA = 25°. Because angles ADB and CBD are inscribed angles of minor arc BC, then the measure of minor arc BC is 2 times the measure of either inscribed angle, which is 25° × 2 = 50°. Since angles ABC and BCD are straight angle supplementary, it follows that angles ABC and BCD are both 180° – 25° = 155°. Likewise, angles ABD and CBD are inscribed angles of arc AD, so that the measure of arc AD is 2 times the measure of any of these angles, which is 25° × 2 = 50°. Add arc AD and arc BC to find arc AB: 50° + 50° = 100°. Note that arc AB is 100°, but this cannot be right, as then arc AB would be greater than arc AC. The mistake is in our previous conclusion that angle BCA = 25°. Let's re-evaluate: The interior angle of a triangle is equal to half the difference of the arc measures of its two adjacent arcs. Therefore, angle BAC = half the difference of arc AC and arc BC, which is (160° – 50°) ÷ 2 = 55°. Now, since we know that arc AB = arc BC + arc AC, it follows that 150° = 50° + 100°, which cannot be true. We need to have 150° = 50° + 90° + 10°. Now it is obvious that, since angle BCD must be 10°, then angle ABD = 75° + 10° = 85°, and the measure of arc BD is 2 × 85° = 170°. Therefore, the measure of arc AD is (160",

Because points A, B, and C are on the circle, the measure of minor arc BC is equal to the measure of ∠BCA.

Because angle ABD is an inscribed angle that bisects minor arc AC, it must also bisect minor arc BC. Since angle ABD is 100°, the measure of minor arc BC is 200°. The question tells us that minor arc BD is 150°. Subtract 150° from 200° to find the measure of minor arc AD. 200° - 150° = 50° is not an answer choice, so we need to rethink our understanding of what is actually being asked. Arc AD is a portion of a circle, and there must be a portion of the circle missing from minor arc BD to form arc AD. We know that minor arc BD measures 150°, but this arc cannot be part of the whole, since arc AD is half as large. The circumference of the circle is 360°. We know that 150° makes up half the length of the remaining part of the circumference after the first half of the remaining half. 360° / 2 = 180°, so 150° is a segment of the circumference of the whole, not the portion of the arc. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 180° - 150° = 30°, which is not an answer choice. However, we can also answer this question by subtracting the measure of minor arc BC from the measure of minor arc AC. The measure of minor arc BC is 200°. The question states that minor arc AC is 160°, so subtracting the measure of minor arc BC from minor arc AC is incorrect. We can find the measure of minor arc AD by subtracting 150° from 160°, but this would be the correct answer if the question were asking for the measure of the arc that is on the other side of arc AC. The measure of the arc that is on the other side of arc AC is minor arc AD's supplementary arc, which is 180° - 160° = 20°. Therefore, if B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AD is 20° + 20° = 40°. Neither 20° nor 40° is an answer choice, so rethinking is necessary again.

If minor arc AC is 160°, then minor arc CD must be 360° – 160° = 200°. Since minor arc BD is 150°, the angle which intercepts that arc must be 150°. Angle BCD is inscribed in the arc BD and is therefore (150°)(2) = 300°. Angle BCD and angle BAD intercept arcs AD and CD, respectively. So, 300° + 180° = 480°, and the measure of the arc they intercept is 480°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD must be 360° – 480° =  -120°, which is still not one of the choices given. Since you are not allowed to have a negative arc, this means that the answer is in the question must be wrong. The only other choice for minor arc AD is therefore the one that includes the 160° and 150° arcs. So, minor arc AD must be 160° + 150° = 310°.

If you would like to review how to use a circle to find an angle of this sort, see the Example. Applying the values we now have, the measure of the angle that arcs AB must be 90° + 10° = 100°. Finally, because the measure of angle B must be 180° (or 360° if you wish), the measure of the minor arc AD is 360° - 100° - 80° = 180°. Alternatively, we could solve this problem by using relationships in geometric terms. The measure of minor arc AD is the measure of minor arc AC plus the measure of minor arc BD. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. Thus the measure of minor arc AD is equal to 160° + 150° = 310° - 360° = 50°. Of course, since we are dealing with circles, we should notice that it would be very difficult to measure the degree measure of the minor arc.",

For example, angle DEC = 360 - angle CBE = 360 - 80 = 280°, so arc DE = angle DEC = 280. Likewise, angle BEC = 150, so arc BC = 150. Similarly, angle DBE = 160 - 80 = 80, so arc BE = angle DBE = 80.

Similarly, since the angles are congruent, the arcs intercepted by those angles are also congruent. So angle BCD must measure 80° and the central angle with measure 150° bisects that central angle to a measure of 75°.

Note that angle D and arc AD are supplementary. Therefore, if you have the measure of either angle and the measure of the arc that is intercepted by that angle, then you know that the other angle is supplementary to that angle and that the remaining arc is the supplement of the arc that the angle intercepts. To solve for the measure of arc AD using the measures of angles A and B, start by finding that the sum of the measures of angles A and D must equal 180°.

However, the correct answer is one of the original answer choices. An alternate way of looking at this is as follows: The minor arcs BA and CD each share the arc opposite a common chord. Therefore, the measure of minor arc BC equals the measure of minor arc CD. Further, a chord is always half of a circle, which is 360°. The radius of a circle divides a chord into two parts that are equal in length. Therefore, minor arcs BA and CD each equal one-half of 180°, or 90°. Because minor arcs BA and CD together have a measure of 180°, the measure of minor arc AD must be 360°-180°, or 180°. This is not one of the answer choices. We've found that the arc measures 80+90+180=330°, but we are looking for the portion that is the minor arc, which is the portion that is between arcs AB and CD. So we have to subtract the arcs AB and CD from the total arc measure of 360°. Therefore, the measure of arc AD is 360°-80°-90°, or 180°. This is still not among the answer choices, so let's take a different approach. First, recall that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Since the question states that B bisects minor arc AC, the angles at points A and C must be the same, making them both 40°, but this is not among the answer choices. Arc AB must have an angle measure of twice the angle measure of point A, so angle A must equal 80° and therefore minor arc AB has a measure of 160°.

The measure of the arc that is bisected by the minor arc  BD (call this measure  x ) is twice the measure of the minor arc BD. Therefore, the measure of arc  BD is 150°. The measure of arc  AB must be 300°, since arc  AD  = arc  BD  + arc  AB . The sum of the two arcs  AC  and  AB  must equal 360°, so the measure of arc  AD  is  360° - 160° - 300°, which is 200° (wait, there is no answer choice 200). There must have been an error in calculating the measure of arc AB, because if the measure of arc BD is 150 and the angle measures 80 and 160, then the measures of arcs  AC  and  AB  must add to 160, not 300, so arc  AB  must be 20. This means arc  AD  is 20 + 160, which is 180. This still doesn't look right, since there is no answer choice 180. However, in calculating the sum of arc AB and arc  AC, arc AB was considered to have measure 160 rather than 20; the measure of arc  BD  was 150, and the measure of angle  A  is half the measure of arc  AC  (160, as stated in the problem), but this cannot be correct if the measure of angle  B  is 80 and arc AB was still considered to be 160.

The measure of the measure of the central angle CBA, the measure of the central angle CBD, and the measure of the central angle BCD are all congruent, and so the measure of the central angle BCD, the measure of the central angle CBA, is also 80 degrees.

Choice B is incorrect and will lead to an extraneous solution. Choice C is incorrect because the sum of the three central angles of a straight line is 180 degrees, not 140 degrees. Choice D is incorrect because twice the measure of angle BCD, or 40 degrees, is not the measure of minor arc AD. Choice E is incorrect.

The sum of the measures of arcs AC and BD is 160° + 150° = 310°, so the measure of arc AD is 360° – 310° = 50°. However, we know that arc AD has to be more than 100°; therefore, we must consider supplements. The question actually states that minor arc BD is 150° and that point B bisects minor arc AC, not that arc BD is inscribed between points A and B. Therefore, minor arc AC is 160°, and its bisector is given as a line through B that cuts out arc AC into two arcs of equal measure: thus arc BC must be 80°. The measure of minor arc BD, therefore, is 150° + 80° = 230°, which is impossible, so this line must be a diameter (vertical angle = 180°, corresponding inscribed angle).

MinArc AD = 360 - (30 + 160) = 170. This is not one of the answer choices. If we go back to drawing the diagram, we can use the radical axis and then create a scheme in our head for which portions of the circle are \"inner\" and which portions of the circle are \"outer\". The center of the circle is indicated by the dot. Then, we draw two circles using the centers that are located at points A and D, with the line that crosses that contains the center point on either side of the center point. If the lengths from the center to the two chords are proportional to their corresponding minor arc measures, we see that the lengths on the top and the bottom are as follows: AB: AO = (30) BD: BO = (30) The arc inscribed between the top and the bottom circles is the same as the sum of the arcs contained by the two chords. So, it must be 30 + 120 = 150°. Since we know the arcs are 150° each and that is the correct answer choice, you don't have to do any additional work on this problem.

Since it’s given that arc BD is 150°, and arc AC is 160°, the sum of these two arcs will be 160 + 150 = 310°. The angle B is the bisector of the arc AD, and so, the measure of arc AD is equal to twice the measure of the inscribed angle A: AD = 2 AB. Since angle B bisects arc AC, arc AB is half the measure of arc AC: arc AB = (1/2) × 160 = 80. Combining this with arc BD gives the measure of arc AD: AD = 80 + 150 = 230. Note that we do not need to add (3/4) × 360 because the angle B is the bisector of arc AC, not the half-angle we get the measure of the third arc by subtracting the two we have used. We get that arc BC is equal to the same angle B. So, the sum of all the arcs is equal to 360: 80 + 150 + BC = 360, and BC = 130.

However, this is an inscribed angle, and inscribed angles are half the size of the central angle they intercept, so the central angle we actually want to find must be half of 240. Half of 240 is 120, but that cannot be correct.

Therefore, the measure of minor arc CD is 2 times 111, or 222. But minor arc BD and minor arc CD form a complete semicircle. Thus, the measure of the entire semicircle is 360 minus the measure of minor arc BD. So the measure of minor arc CD is 360 minus 150, or 210. Because the measure of minor arc AD is the sum of the measures of minor arcs AC and CD, the measure of minor arc AD is 160 + 210, or 370. However, 370 is not one of the choices. Thus, you can eliminate choices A, B, C, and D. But if the statement \"B bisects minor arc AC\" is true, then 210 must also be the measure of minor arc AB. This makes 210 plus 160, or 370, the measure of minor arc AD. Eliminating choices B, C, and D is not enough; eliminate only choice E. As the measure of arc AB must be less than the measure of the minor arc AC it stands on, and it must also be less than the measure of the minor arc AD it stands on. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AB must be less than 160. Eliminate choice B. Similarly, the measure of arc BD is less than the measure of the arc DC it stands on, and it must also be less than the measure of the arc AD it stands on. Therefore, the measure of the minor arc BD must be less than 150. Eliminate choice D. Thus, the measure of minor arc AD must be 160 plus the measure of arc BD. But the measure of arc BD is less than 150, so the measure of minor arc AD is greater than 160.

We can subtract 75° and 80° from 360° to find the measure of arc AD. 360°-75°=285°-80°=205°. In addition, because angle B bisects minor arc AC, it divides it into two arcs, each 160°/2 = 80° long. Therefore, arc AB is 80°. Since arc AD and arc BC have the same measure, we can subtract the measure of arc AB from the measure of arc AB and arc BC together to find the measure of arc DC.

Since angle B is part of angle DAB, then the sum of the measures of angles A and B must be 180° because these two angles are supplementary.  80° + B = 180°.

The sum of the measures of angles B and C must be 180° because they are supplementary angles. So, the measure of angle C is 80°. Since the measures of the intercepted arcs are proportional to the measures of their corresponding angles, the measures of minor arc AB, minor arc BC, and minor arc CD must also be proportional to the measures of the corresponding angles. Thus, minor arc BC has the same measure as minor arc BD, and minor arc CD has the same measure as minor arc AC. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the measure of minor arc CD plus the measure of minor arc BD. Thus, the measure of minor arc AD is 160° + 150°, which is 310°.

Since angle A measures 80°, the equation a, plus b, equals 160, plus s, plus t, where a and b are the measures of arcs AC and BD, respectively, can be written as 80 plus t, equals 160 plus s. Since  b, equals s plus 30, we can add b to both sides of the last equation and add s to both sides to obtain 80 plus t, plus 30, plus s, equals 160 plus s, plus s, plus 30. Combining like terms on both sides yields 110 plus t, equals 190, so 110 equals t, and s is equal to 80.

MICA = 160 and MIB = 150, so MIA = 200 and MBA = 100. MICA and MBA together is a semicircle (so a 180 degree arc), and since they each contain equal arc length they must be half the total of 360, so each is 180/2 = 90, meaning that either MIB and MIA together are a semicircle (180 degrees) and so is each 90, or that MIA is a semicircle and MIB is 30 degrees; if we consider this case we see that the answer is 90 - ",

To complete the problem, you might guess answer (E). Alternatively, you could notice that each answer choice is 10° short of the sum of the measures of the minor arcs. If you divide 10° by 2, you get 5°. However, if you divide 5° by 2, you get 2.5°, which cannot be a measure of an arc. Therefore, you can divide the difference of 10° by the smallest angle, the measure of arc AC, which is 80°, in order to find the common denominator. 10° ÷ 80° = (160°) ÷ 80° = 2. This gives you the common multiplier, 160°. Adding this to the difference of 10° between the sum of the angles and the measures of the arcs, you get 160° + 10° = 170°. However, this is the measure of arc AB, not minor arc AD. The measure of minor arc AD is the difference of the measures of arcs AC and AB. Therefore, minor arc AD = 160° - 170° =  -10° This is clearly impossible. Adding 10° is equivalent to decreasing the measure of arc AD by 10°, or, equivalently, adding 10° to the measure of minor arc BD.

Therefore, the measure of arc AD is the difference between the measure of arc AOC and the measure of arc DC, which is 80° - 210°, or -130°. This is a negative value because minor arcs cannot be negative. If you are not given angles to use, you must find angles using relationships with angles from the center of the circle. Instead, of multiplying angles by 3 and 4, add the measures of minor arcs AC and BD to get 310°. Since angle C is not an angle in the same arc as these 2 angles, but is a measure of the arc AD, you can only determine arc AD by subtracting arc BD from 360. The sum of the measures of the 3 arcs is 360°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 360° - 310°, which equals 50°.

Therefore, it's not a bisected angle, which means we can’t use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the answer. Start with the given arc measures: MAO = 160°, and MBP = 150. Don't label angles AO and BO because they are inscribed angles, not an exterior angle of a triangle. To begin, place point M on arc AC, and point P on arc BD, such that the two angle subtended by AO and BP subtend the same arc measure (close together if not touching). Angle APB is bisected by angle AOB, so angle AOB will be the same as the measure of arc AP + arc PB: Arc measures = angle AP + arc AP + arc PB + angle PB Arc measures = angle AOB = AP + PB = 160 + 150 = 310° Arc MAO + arc AB = angle AOB + arc AB = 160 + 75 = 235° Now divide the circle into four pieces: Arc AB, PB, AB, and MAO. Sum of the arc measures around the whole circle = 360. Each piece has the same measure, and we can use them to find the arc measure we want. If we get 70, each piece would equal 90. Then A, B, and D would be on the same arc, and the interior angle of triangle ABD will be the bisector of angle",

However, since the 80° formed by angle A at the center of the circle, is also part of the measure of minor arc AD, the measure of minor arc AD is actually 360° – 80° – 75°, or 205° – 75° = 130°.

            " which is less than 180°, so you can conclude that the measure of angle C is 180° - 155° = 25°. Since angles A and C both subtend the same arc AD, their measures are equal. Therefore, 80° = 25° doesn't make sense; thus, the inscribed angle A cannot be the minor arc AC. Consequently, arc AC cannot be on one side of the circle, and the inscribed angles C and D can't subtend the same arc; they can't both be on the same side of the circle either. Therefore, the inscribed angles C and A must subtend the same arc BD.  Therefore, angle A = angle D is equal to half of the measure of arc BD, which is (150°)/2, or 75°.

Because the angles and arcs they cut are proportional, we can infer that minor arc AD has the same measure as major arc CD.

If minor arcs AC and BD have measures 160° and 150°, respectively, and minor arc AD is as small as the large semiarc CD then arc AD must be as big as the large semiarc AC. The difference between the arc measures is therefore 160° – 150° = 10°. Hence, minor arc CD has measure 160° + 10° = 170°. The major arc AC is half of the circle, so the semiarc AC measures 180°.

Since 115 is not in the answer choices, look at the central angles to be intercepted by the arcs and arcs that subtend them. Each minor arc starts at one of the points on the circumference and ends at the point diametrically opposite. For example, arc AC starts at point A and ends at point C. For arc AC, it is from the position of point A, to the position of point C, so the angle that subtends it, angle AC, is not what you need. Therefore, the measure of the central angle that intercepts minor arc AD is the angle that subtends the arc starting at point D and ending at the point that is diametrically opposite point D.

Subtracting the measures of angles A, B, and D from 205° leaves angle E with a measure of 10°. Since angles A and C and angle B and D are consecutive angles, we can conclude that they form an angle of 20° (180° - 10°). Therefore, angles A and C and angles B and D form isosceles trapezoids and equal arcs AE and CF are 90°. If the measure of minor arc AC is 160°, then the measure of arc CF must be 80°. If angles A and C are vertically opposite angles and the measure of arc AC is 160°, then angle A is 80°, and angle C is 25°.

So, again, the statement to be proved is false, and minor arcs AC and BD must overlap. Minor arc AD must include both parts, so we must determine which part of minor arc AC to count.

The measure of minor arc AD is the difference between the measure of minor arc BC and the measure of minor arc BD, which is 77.5 – 150 = 17.5. Since this is not a correct answer, try another approach. Note that the sum of the measures of angles A and D is 135°, because the measure of angle B is 75°. The sum of the measures of arcs AB, BC, and CD is the difference between 360° and the sum of the measures of angles A, B, and C, which is 180°.

Thus, the measure of minor arc AD is 150°.\nThat is not among the answer choices. However, subtracting the measure of arc BC from the sum of the measures of arcs AC and AD results in the measure of arc AD. Thus, the measure of arc AD is 160° – 10° = 150°.

In order to get the value of 160°, we need to calculate the measure of a 90° portion of the circle outside of segment AB that is not on the portion between C and D. The measure of minor arc BD is 150°, so the measure of the portion of the circle that is outside of segment BD and segment CD is 90° + 150° = 240°. Since the portion of the circle outside of segment CD is twice the length of the portion outside of segment AB, the measure of the portion of the circle that is outside of segment AB is half the measure of the portion outside of segment CD.

In order to find the measure of minor arc AD, we must add the measure of minor arc AC to the measure of minor arc BD. Since angle C is between arcs AC and BD, its measure is half the measure of the arc that it intercepts, the segment AB. The measure of arc AC is given as 160° and the measure of arc BD is given as 150°. The measure of arc AB is therefore 75°. The measure of arc AD is therefore 160° + 75° = 235°.

However, we can show that the other answer choices are also not possible as follows: If the measure of arc AD were 80°, the sum of the measures of arcs AC, BD, and AD is 350°. Because the sum of the measures of arcs AC and BD is 310°, arc AD must measure more than 40°. Likewise, if the measure of arc AD were 130°, the sum of the measures of arcs AC and BD would be 290°, so arc AD would have to measure more than 70°.

A counterexample was that the minor arcs and angles made from the points on the circumference of the circle, illustrated below, measure as follows: $\\boxed{\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} & $& B & C & $\\\\ \n\\hline & $& (150°) & (40°) & $\\\\\n$ & $& \\ & (100°) & (60°) & $\n\\end{tabular}}$ Thus, it was concluded that there is a relationship between the measures of the inscribed angles and the minor arcs that the measures of the angles are half the measures of the intercepted arcs. In this problem, minor arc BD is bisected by arc AC. Therefore, it is concluded that minor arc AD is half the measure of the remaining portion of the circumference that is created when minor arc BD is bisected.

Consider a third angle that is formed at point D, so that it is greater than 90°. This creates an acute angle at point D. Because an acute angle is half the intercepted arc, the measure of the intercepted arc must be double the measure of the acute angle at point D. Therefore, the measure of the intercepted arc that is formed at point D is twice the sum of the measures of angles A and B, which is 190°.

The measure of minor arc BD must be 180° minus the measure of minor arc AD, so 180° – 190° = –10°, but this doesn’t make sense because negative degrees are not possible, and arcs must have a positive measure.

Angle B is not bisecting arc AC; instead, it is bisecting minor arc BD, which is not arc AC. The angle at the center of a circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The measure of the center angle is twice the measure of minor arc BC, since the diameter is twice the radius, which is half the measure of an inscribed angle. So, the measure of angle B is twice the measure of the inscribed angle B. Since the measure of minor arc BD is 150°, the measure of minor arc BC is 300°. Now, you can see that 160° + 300° = 460°.

But angles A and B are vertical angles, and angles C and D are vertical angles. So, the measure of angle D is 180° - 25°, or 155°. That is, the measures of angles A and D add up to 235°. Now the sum of the measures of the four angles around the circle is 360°. Thus, the sum of the measures of the remaining angles must be 360° - 235°, or 125°.

The measure of minor arc AD is 2×90 = 180°, which is not among the answer choices. The mistake was in the sum of the measures of angles A, B, C, and D. To find the measure of minor arc AD, we must first find the measure of angle A plus the measure of angle D, which is 155°. The sum of the measures of the angles on a circle is 360°. The measure of the angles on arc BD must be 360° minus the sum of the measures of angles A and D, which is 205°. The measure of minor arc BD is half of 205°, or 102.5°. The measure of minor arc BC is the same as the measure of minor arc BD, which is 102.5°. Finally, the measure of minor arc AC is the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB and BC, which is 102.5° + 80°, or 182.5°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 180° minus the measure of minor arc AC, or 180° - 182.5°, or -2.5°, which is not among the answer choices.

Minor arc AB plus minor arc BC equals minor arc AC, or 160° + 150° = 310°. Minor arc AD is 360° minus the measure of minor arc AB and minor arc BD, which is 360° – 310° = 50°. Since 50° is not among the answer choices, it cannot be the correct answer. minor arc BD is 150°. Thus, minor arc AD is 360° minus the measure of minor arcs BC and BD, which is 360° – 150° = 210°.

In terms of the answer choices, minor arc AD is 180° – 30°, which is 150°. Note that if you forgot that minor arcs AC and BD together form a semicircle and had taken the answer choices at face value, you could have worked out that minor arc AD is equal to 180° – 160° – 150°. If you have trouble remembering that arcs and angles are related, think of the the sum of the measures of any two inscribed angles that cut off the same arc is 180°. The third inscribed angle cuts the same arc as both of the first two, and thus can also be labeled as the angle opposite the chord which shares the side opposite the arc being bisected.\nThe best answer is A.",
