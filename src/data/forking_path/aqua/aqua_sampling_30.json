            "<|end_header_id|>\n\n## Step 1: First, we need to understand that choosing 2 oranges from a basket of 10 is a combination problem, not permutation, since the order of selection does not matter.\nThis means we are looking for the number of combinations of 2 items chosen from a set of 10, without regard to the order in which they are chosen.\n\n## Step 2: The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\nIn this case, n = 10 (total oranges) and k = 2 (oranges to choose).\n\n## Step 3: Plug the values into the combination formula: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!).\nSimplifying this, we get C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorials involved. 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, 2! = 2 * 1, and 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\nThe equation simplifies to C(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)).\n\n## Step 5: Cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator. We can cancel out 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, leaving us with 10 * 9 / 2.\nThis simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication and division: (10 * 9) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\",
