One formula for the length of a shadow for each set of ( x : height,  h : shadow ) of a line bar will be d  = ( Δ h ) x  s , here Δ h  is the difference in height for an ant's two versions, as well as the length for each bar, all in inches. For one version of the table, Δ h  is 2 and  s  is 10:   using the scale factor. . Since Δ h  is 2 inches for the taller ant, but  s  is in inches, using the same scale factor must let Δ h  and  s  correspond by setting 2x  = 10, which yields  x  = 5 for a scale factor of 5. Substituting the values in the formula for the shadow length for a line bar yields d  = 2 × 5 = 10. For the table of values, using Δ h  and  s  based on the taller ant, the corresponding line bar length would be 10 inches. (This can also be done in three steps.) In the second version of the table the 5 scale factor has been applied to the length of the shadow (s):   6 × 5  = 30 or 2. Substituting the values in the formula for the length of a shadow bar in this case yields d  = 3 × 30 = 90. We choose the smallest version to be the answer for the shadow of the taller ant.

To see why, take the ant that's tall (call its height  h h  ) and call the length of its shadow  s  . If you were to look at this problem using the tall ant, you'll see that a line from the top of its head to the end of its shadow is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with base  s  and height  h  . We know from the Pythagorean theorem that  a ^{2} +  b ^{2} =  c ^{2}, so we have  s ^{2} +  h ^{2} =  c ^{2}. Plugging in  h  = 4 and  s  = 10 gives 100 + 16 =  c ^{2}. Since  c  = 10,  c  =  a hypotenuse.\n The two sides of the hypotenuse are made of a rectangle of the line, which has  s ^{2} =  h ^{2} , where  h  = 6.\nTo find the length of the shadow, we can compute  s ^{2} by finding 6 ^{2} = s ^{2} and taking the square root of both sides to solve for  s . Thus  s  =  $\\sqrt{36}$  = 6. The correct answer is (C).\nNote that the answer could also be determined by simply using  proportion.

Let's take a closer look at the first ant, and assume that it is now 2 inches tall. We could think of this ant as 2/4 of the size of the first ant. If it is 2 inches tall, its shadow should be 5 inches long, and thus the total height of the 4-to-3 ratio is 8 inches. If we do the same thing for the second ant, we see that it is 4/6 of the size of the second ant and that its shadow should be 5.4 inches long. Adding the two heights of the ants together, we get 2 + 4 = 6, and adding their shadows together, we get 5 + 5.4 = 10.4. Since our result is not an answer choice, the second ant is probably taller than 4 inches tall. Let's do the problem again. If we know that the first ant is 4 inches tall and that the second ant is 4 inches tall, we know that the total height of the ants is 8 inches.

Because the bases of the triangles are proportional, the height and shadow of the two ants are also proportional.

The angle of elevation of the sun is the same for both ants. So we can consider the triangle with the taller ant as the hypotenuse and use the tangent function to find the length of the shadow. Recall that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In particular, the tangent of the angle of elevation of the sun, which equals, opposite over adjacent, is, in this case, 6 over 30, or 1 over 5. This means that the angle of elevation of the sun makes the ratio of the vertical distance from the top of the sun to the tip of the ant's shadow to the length of the shadow in the same as 1 to 5. This implies that the shadow of the shorter ant, when measured from the top of the sun to the ground, is 5 times the length of the shadow of the taller ant.

If you find it difficult to use the ratio method, you can use similar triangles to solve the problem. Imagine that the ground is smooth and all obstacles have been removed. Draw the actual shadow. The triangles are similar, and so the ratio of the height of each ant to the length of its shadow is equal. Since 4 over 10, equals, 6 over x, cross-multiplying gives 4 x, equals, 60 over x, equals 30, as shown above. Therefore, the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant is 7.5 inches. Alternatively, draw a diagram that includes a portion of the back of each ant, as shown below. In both triangles, the angle of elevation of the sun is the same. Since the two triangles are similar, we know that the ratio of the height of each ant to the length of its shadow is equal. So the ratio of 4 over 10, equals, 6 over y. Cross-multiplying gives 4 y, equals, 60 over 10, or 6 y, equals, 30. Dividing both sides by 6 yields y, equals, 5. It follows that the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant is 5 inches.

            " the equation by 4, we get x  = 15. Therefore, the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant is 15 inches.\nAlternate approach: Since the two ants are standing side-by-side, their shadows are congruent trapezoids. The two figures formed by the ant's height and its shadow have the same height, so they are similar. The ratio of their bases is equal to the ratio of their heights. Using these two facts, we can set up the proportion 4 over 10 equals 6 over  x. Cross-multiplying, we get 4 x  = 6 times 10, or 4 x  = 60. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x  = 15. Another way to set up the proportion is to think of the two heights and their corresponding shadows as two pairs of similar congruent triangles. This leads to the proportion 4 over 6 equals 10 over  x. Cross-multiplying, we get 4 x  = 60. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x  = 15, which is the same result as in the previous solution.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect and may result from calculating the ratio of the heights to the shadows of just the first ant.

The answer is not 40, so let's choose a different approach.  Notice that the heights of the two ants are 4 and 6. Therefore, the height of the taller ant is 6 over 4, or 3 over 2, the height of the shorter ant. The heights of the two ants are in the ratio 2 to 3. The shadows are in the same ratio, so the height of the taller ant over the height of the shorter ant, or 6 over 4, is equal to the length of the shadow of the taller ant over the length of the shadow of the shorter ant. We can write the equation 6 over 4, equals, x over 10, where  x  is the length of the shadow of the taller ant. Cross-multiplying, we get 6 times 10 = 4 x, or 60 = 4 x .

To do so, draw the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 4 inches and 10 inches. Draw the hypotenuse of another right triangle with legs of 6 inches and  x . The two triangles are similar triangles, so we can set up the ratio of the two triangles as follows: (4 over 6) equals, (10 over x ). Cross-multiplying, we get 4 x  = 60, as we have seen. The same ratio will work if we compare the lengths of the corresponding sides of the two triangles. If we compare the heights and lengths of the two triangles, we get the proportion 4 over 6 equals 10 over x . Cross-multiplying, we get 4 x  = 60, as we have seen.

Cross-multiplying, we get 4 times 3, equals, 6 over  x , or 12 equals 6 over  x . Dividing both sides by 6, we get  x  = 2 x 3, or 2 = 2 x , and  x  = 15.\nThe best answer is (D).",

(B) is the answer because, when you take 6 over 10, you need to subtract 6 from 4 in order to get the height of the taller ant.
