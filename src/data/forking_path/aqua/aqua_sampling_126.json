(5 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 5 books, which is 120.\n\n\n## Step 4: Since the Hindi book is also special and will occupy another position, leaving 4 books to be arranged.\nIn this case, there are 4!

(3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 3 books in this case, which is 6. There are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 2 books, which is 2. There is 1! (1 factorial) way to arrange the remaining 1 book, which is 1.\n\n## Step 6: Combine all these to find the total number of possible ways to arrange the books in a specific order.\nMultiply the number of ways to arrange each position together, giving us 6 x 120 x 24 x 6 x 2 x 1 = 17280 but we need to divide this value by the number of possible sequences of 6 items: 6!/3!, where 3 is the number of special books and 6 is the total number of books, and 720 is 6! (total number of possible arrangements), to adjust for double counting, because we counted each possible permutation of the 6 books 6! times.\n\n\n## Step 7: So, to adjust for double counting of possible arrangements we divide our calculated value by 6!/3! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3!/3! which we divide to 6!/3! = 6 x 5 x 4 = 120.\nThis gives us 17280/120 = 144.\n\n\n## Step 8: However, there are actually 3 special positions on the shelf.\nWe need to adjust the calculation to",

However, in this case, some of the objects are of the same type (i.e., the six books of each type are identical), so we need to correct for overcounting.\n## Step 4:  For distinguishable books, the formula would be 6!, but since some of the books are indistinguishable, we use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements: n! / (n1! * n2! * ... nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, etc., are the counts of each item that repeats.\n## Step 5:  Since all six books are of the same type and there are no other repetitions, we have six indistinguishable items. The formula simplifies to 6! / 6! because there are 6 identical books, and 6! in the denominator cancels out the arrangement of any single type of book, leaving us only with the arrangements of the arrangement of the 6 books.\n## Step 6:  Calculating 6! gives us 720, and then we divide by 6! which also gives us 720.\n## Step 7:  Thus, the total number of ways to arrange these 6 books is 720.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$",
