So, the profit from a 5% discount is 0.95x.\n\n## Step 3: Next, let's calculate the profit made when a 7% discount is given.\nWhen a 7% discount is given, the shopkeeper earns a profit of 93% of the marked price. So, the profit from a 7% discount is 0.93x.\n\n## Step 4: We are given that the profit from a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than the profit from a 5% discount.\nSo, we can write the equation: 0.95x - 0.93x = 15.\n\n## Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get:\n0.02x = 15.\n\n## Step 6: Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.02.\nx = 15 / 0.02 = 750.\n\nThe final answer is: $750",
            " find the marked price, we can use the following equation:\n\nProfit = Marked price - Cost price - Discount\n\nLet's say the marked price is x. The discount given by the shopkeeper is 5% of the marked price, which is 0.05x.\n\nIf the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7% instead, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. This means the profit is 93% of the marked price, which is 0.93x.\n\nWe know that the difference in profit is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.93x - 0.05x = 15\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n0.88x = 15\n\nDividing both sides by 0.88, we get:\n\nx = 15/0.88 = 17.03 ≈ 700\n\nThe closest answer choice to 700 is Rs. 700, so the marked price of the watch is approximately Rs. 700.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Rs. 700.\n\nBut, the watch costs the shopkeeper Rs. 700 after 5% discount. So the total price at which the shopkeeper has to purchase the watch is (x - 0.05x) = 0.95x, i.e. 0.95 * 700 = 665. So, the correct answer is 700 - 665 = 35 more. When 35 is subtracted from it we get the exact answer.\n So 700 - 35 =  665 \n\nThe profit is: 665 - 0.87 * 665 = 665 - 581.5 = 83.5\n 700 - 665 = 35, so total Markup = 35 \nPercentage markup = (Markup/Cost price ) × 100%\nHere the Cost price = 665 and  Markup = 35\n\nSo 0.05 * 665 = 33.25  and 32.75 = 5% of the MRP\n we find 32.75 of MRP is 33.25  = 700\n So, Marked Price (Selling price) is = 700.",

Also, the profit at 7% discount, P_7, is \\(x - (0.07x)\\) which simplifies to \\(0.93x -\\) Cost Price.\n\nThe problem mentions that P_5 - P_7 = 15.

However, we can take a closer look at the options and see if we can find one that's close.\n\nSince 214.29 is closer to 217 than to 200, let's try multiplying 217 by 0.95:\n\n217 × 0.95 = 205.85\n\nWe also know that the profit is Rs. 15 when the 7% discount is given, so we can calculate the marked price:\n\nProfit = 0.07 x Marked Price\n= x - 0.93x\n= 0.07x\n\nSubstitute the value of x = 217 ( Closest to 214.29) into the equation:\n\n0.07(217) = 15\n\nLet's try MP = 750 and see:\n\nSP = 0.93(750) = 692.50\n\nCost Price = MP - SP = 750 - 692.50 = 57.50\n\nProfit = CP - SP = 750 - 692.50 = 57.50 \n\nSubstitute the value of MP = 750 and CP = 72.50 into the equation:\n\n0.07 × 72.50 = 5.125\nSince the given 15 is 5.125 x 100/ 5, mark price will be = Rs 750",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(95/100)x - x = 15\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n95x - 100x = 1500\n\n-5x = 1500\n\nNow, divide both sides by -5:\n\nx = 300\n\nSo, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 300.\n\nHowever, we can also check this by finding the profit when he gives a 5% discount and 7% discount, and subtracting the profit in both cases to check if we get the same answer of Rs. 150.\n\nLet's calculate the profit when he gives a 5% discount:\n\nProfit = Marked price - Selling price\n= x - (95/100)x\n= x - 0.95x\n= 0.05x\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit when he gives a 7% discount:\n\nProfit = Marked price - Selling price\n= x - (93/100)x\n= x - 0.93x\n= 0.07x\n\nNow, we subtract the profit in both cases:\n\n0.05x - 0.07x = -0.02x = -15\n\nThis means the shopkeeper is losing Rs. 15, which matches the given information.\n\nThe marked price of the watch is indeed Rs. 300, which is not listed among the options. However, if we calculate the exact value, we get:\n\n300 = Rs. 300.\n\nWe can think this as 3 digit number, 300 i.e 3 × 100.\n\nSo our answer is 300 × 100 = 30000",

Convert each answer choice to dollars: A) 697.50 ≈ 697.5 US dollars (rounding for conversions error) B) 712.50 ≈ 712.5 US dollars C) 787.50 ≈ 787.5 US dollars D) 750 ≈ 750 US dollars E) 780 ≈ 780 US dollars \n\nIf the correct answer is option (C), then the shopkeeper will give a 5% discount when he sells the watch for 787.50. The shopkeeper will get the selling price of the watch when he sells it at a 5% discount: 787.50 - (5/100)787.50 = 750. \n\nA 7% discount on the marked price of 787.50 will give a selling price of: 787.50 - (7/100)787.50 = 732.875, which is not equal to 727. \n\nNow, we need to verify our answer. The shopkeeper will get a selling price of 787.50 if he sells the watch at a 5% discount, and the shopkeeper will get a",

Therefore,\n\n0.05x = 15\n\n0.05x = 15\n\nx = 300\n\nSince this is also not among the options, we'll use a different method.\n\nLet the cost price of the watch be CP.\n\nThe shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, so the selling price (SP) after this discount is 93% of the marked price (CP), i.e., (93/100) × x.\n\nThe profit made by the shopkeeper after the first discount is (95 - 93) = 2% of the marked price, i.e., (2/100) × x.\n\nThe profit made by the shopkeeper after the second discount is 7% of the marked price, i.e., (7/100) × x.\n\nAccording to the question,",

This means that the profit is Rs. 15 when the 7% discount is given and it is Rs. 15 more when the 5% discount is given.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\nProfit when 5% discount is given = Selling price - Cost price\nProfit when 7% discount is given = Selling price - Cost price\n\nLet the cost price be CP. Then:\n\n(0.95x - CP) = 15 ...................... (i)\n\n(0.93x - CP) = CP + 15 ......................

This is a tricky question because the mark-up percentage (%) isn't the same as the percentage of profit. The shopkeeper gives a 5% mark-up and a 7% discount, which results in a loss of Rs. 15.\n\nTo find the correct answer, let's re-analyze the problem. Let's say the cost price (C.P.) of the watch is Rs. 100. The shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, so the selling price (S.P.) is:\n\n100 - (5% of 100) = 100 - 5 = 95\n\nThe shopkeeper makes a profit of Rs. 5 (100 - 95 = 5).\n\nNow, if the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the S.P. would be:\n\n100 - (7% of 100) = 100 - 7 = 93\n\nThe shopkeeper now makes a profit of Rs. 7 (100 - 93 = 7).\n\nWe know that the difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation:\n\n7 - 5 = 15\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense, because the shopkeeper is actually losing money by giving the 7% discount!\n\nLet's try again.

Since the cost price is Rs. 475, the shopkeeper's profit is:\n\nProfit = Selling price - Cost price = 475 - 475 = Rs. 0 (This doesn't make sense, let's try again!)\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake somewhere!\n\nLet's go back to the question: \"If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit.\"\n\nSo, let's say the cost price is x.\n\nWhen the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is 93% of the cost price, which is 0.93x.\n\nThe profit earned is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is:\n\nProfit = Selling price - Cost price = 0.93x - x = 0.93x - x = 0.03x\n\nBut we know that the profit is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.03x = 15\n\nDividing both sides by 0.03, we get:\n\nx = 500\n\nThis is the same as before!

Let's revisit the calculations.\n\nWhen the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is 0.93x, and the profit is the difference between the marked price and the selling price.

Therefore, the marked price is 100/95 = 1.05 times the cost price. If the 7% discount gives a profit of Rs. 15, the selling price is 100 - 93 = 7/100 of the cost price. \n\nThe cost price in the second case is also 1.05 times the cost price and that is Rs. 15 less than in the first case. This makes the second case 1.05/1.05 times the cost price. \n\nHence cost price = (1 - 15/5) = 4/5 of the marked price. Therefore, the marked price = 1 / (4/5) = 5/4 of the cost price. \n\nSince cost price is also 1.05 times the cost price, the cost price = Rs. 13.51. Hence, the marked price = Rs. (5/4) * 13.51 = Rs. 16.78 * (5/4) * (4/3) = Rs. 20.3 * (15/5) = Rs. 78",

Let's try:\n\nLet the selling price be x and the cost price be y.\n\nWhen the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 0.95y.\n\nWhen the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is 0.93y.\n\nThe difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.93y - 0.95y = 15\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-0.02y = 15\n\nDividing both sides by -0.02, we get:\n\ny = 750\n\nSo the cost price is Rs. 750.

When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of the marked price, which is 0.95x.\n\nWhen the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is 93% of the marked price, which is 0.93x.\n\nThe difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.93x - 0.95x = -15\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-0.02x = -15\n\nDividing both sides by -0.02, we get:\n\nx = 15 / 0.02\nx = 750\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.",
