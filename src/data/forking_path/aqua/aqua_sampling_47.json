Set up a ratio based on the height of the pole and its shadow length, and then find the height of the tree. The ratios should be set equal to each other, which means the ratio of the height of the pole over the shadow length of the pole must equal the ratio of the height of the tree over the shadow length of the tree. To set up the equation, set the two ratios equal to each other and cross-multiply. $\\frac{14 \\text { metres }}{10 \\text { metres }}=\\frac{x \\text { metres }}{15 \\text { metres }} \\Rightarrow 14 \\times 15=x \\times 10 \\Rightarrow x=21 \\) metres. The tree's shadow is 15 metres, and its shadow falls within a proportion equal to the ratio of the height of the pole, which is 14 to the shadow length of the pole, which is 10 metres. Therefore, the tree's height will be 21 metres.\nThe best answer is A.",

Similarly, the line going from the base of the tree to the end of the shadow is 15 metres.

The height of the tree is thus 28 / 3, which is approximately 9.3 m.

You can use a different proportion based on the heights of the pole and the tree and the length of the pole's shadow and the length of the tree's shadow.

Therefore, the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow is also 7:5. Now, we know that the height of the tree and the length of its shadow are in the ratio 7:5, so we can use a table to record these values: $\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\text { height }}{\\text { length }}=\\frac{7}{5} \\frac{\\text { height }}{\\text { length }}\\end{array}$ We have the height of the pole, which is 14 m, and the length of its shadow, which is 10 m. Plugging this into our table, we get  $\\frac{14}{10}=\\frac{7}{5}$ , or 14 = 7 × 2. We know that 7 × 2 = 14 and that 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5. Since 7 × 2 = 14, we know that 7 ÷ 2 = 1 ÷ 0.5, or 3.5.

            "Alternate approach: You could use the above steps to find the height of the tree that casts a shadow of 5 m. However, because of answer choices, we must remember that these are ratios. Therefore, we know that the two objects (the pole and the tree) are similar because they have the same angles of elevation. The above proportion and results can also be used to set up a similar ratio involving 1/14. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion: $\\frac{1}{14}=\\frac{1}{h}$ , \\( \\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{14}=\\frac{1}{21} \\\\ 14=21\\end{array} \\) This means that the height of the tree must be 21 m.\n Alternate approach: The same proportion used in part (B) can be multiplied by 1.5 (the scale factor of similar triangles) to find the height of the tree: $\\frac{h}{15}=\\frac{1.5(14)}{1.5(10)}$ Simplifying, we get $\\frac{h}{15}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $h=3.75$ m We can check our answer by substituting 21 for  h  in the equation  h  = 3.75, getting 21 = 3.75.",

            " Since the tree is shorter than the pole, 21 isn't an answer choice. We can try 22, 20, and 24. To eliminate the choices that aren't multiples of 2(10), we can try the easiest first. If we divide 20 by 2, we get 10, so 20 doesn't fit in the ratio. 22, on the other hand, is 2(11), so we can check this next. This is the first multiple of 2 that is in the ratio. If we divide 10 by 2, we get 5, so 22 could be the height of the tree. Checking our answer, the fraction  $\\frac{22}{15}$  is greater than  $\\frac{14}{10}$ . Because the fraction  $\\frac{14}{10}$  was greater than  $\\frac{11}{7}$ , the tree would be taller than the pole if the height of the tree was 22. The fraction  $\\frac{14}{10}$  is greater than  $\\frac{11}{7}$ , so the height of the tree must be greater than 22; eliminate 22 as an answer. We try 24. Dividing 10 by 2, we get 5.
