The dog \"eats exactly 1/3 of the food remaining.\" The good thing about ratios is that they're unaffected by the quantities of the values being compared, only their proportions. The first step is to find the fraction of the food the dog didn't eat during the first 4 hours of the day. Because the dog eats the same amount of food each hour and he ate food for the first 4 hours of the day, the amount of food remaining after the first 4 hours must be a multiple of the amount eaten and also the amount of food remaining after 4 hours will have to equal the original amount of food the bowl started with. The only multiple that can be evenly divided into 1/3 after taking into account that the dog eats 1/3 of the food each time the amount remaining after four hours must be 2/3. So, by elimination, the answer is (C). This question can also be solved with Ratios: $\\frac{1 \\text { all in a bowl }}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{2}{9}$",

It will be easiest to calculate with a diagram, as shown below.\nSince the dog ate one third of the food after every hour, it is evident that the first third plus the second third plus the third third of the dog's bowl now contains all of the original food. In other words, all of the original food is represented by (1st + 2nd + 3rd), and the graph above is a trinomial that represents the three terms. Therefore, the answers can be reduced by simplifying this expression:  (1st + 2nd + 3rd) = (1 + 2 + 3) = 6. This can be found by using the distributive property. Since all of the original 6 represents the 100%, 1/3 (6) of the original 100% equals 20%. 2nd 2/3 of the original food is therefore 20%, leaving a remaining 40%. \nThe best answer is A.",

Thus, 80/81 of the dog food was remaining just before 8:00 pm. At noon, Jim fed his dog, which means that 80/81 of the food was the amount that the dog still had. The fraction of food remaining before noon, the 2 hours before the dog ate, was, therefore, (80/81) × (2/3) = 160/243.

This can be rewritten as: 0.5<frac{x}{3} but x minus 2x over 3 is less than 1, to solve for x, start by multiplying through by 3 to get: 1.5<x but x minus 2x is less than 3, or negative 1, to solve for x, solve the two parts of the inequality separately. The first part, 1.5<x, can be rewritten as x is greater than 1.5, and can also be graphed on a number line as all the way out from 1.5 to infinity. However, the only thing that will make a difference is if there is 1 or fewer unit of food, in which case x is just 1.5. The second part, x minus 2x is less than negative 1, can be solved by first combining like terms, or -x is less than negative 1 and dividing both sides by negative 1 (do not forget to flip the inequality sign), x is greater than 1. Therefore the answer is a point. (The value of x that makes the inequalities true simultaneously is called the solution.  ) 1.5 is not the solution. From 1.5 to negative infinity, there is more than 1 point satisfying the first part of the inequality and fewer than 1 point satisfying the second, so this range contains the solution. 1.5 is also the solution.

Therefore, after Jim had fed his dog once, the percent of food in the bowl was 100%, so for each additional feeding, multiply this amount by  $\\frac{2}{3}$ . After the second feeding at 9:00 am, Jim had eaten  $\\frac{1}{3}$  of the dog food and  $\\frac{2}{3}$  of the dog food remained.

At 11:00 am, the dog ate 1/3 of the food remaining from the day before. The amount remaining from the day before was 5/9, which, when multiplied by 1/3, equals 5/27 of the original amount.

Finally, it ate 2/3 of the remaining 4/9 or 8/27 of the food by 12:00, so the percent of the original food left was 8/27. Convert 8/27 to a percent: you multiply 8 by 100 and divide by 27: (8 × 100) ÷ 27 = 296.

Because half of 100% is 50% and two-thirds of 100% is approximately 67%, the amount of food remaining after the first feeding is approximately 66 2/3%, or 2/3 of the food. In the second feeding, the dog ate 1/3 of the dog food, so the amount of dog food remaining was 2/3 times 2/3, or 4/9. Two-thirds is between 2/3 and 1, and four-ninths is between two-ninths and three-ninths. Two-ninths of 100 is 2, and three-ninths of 100 is approximately 3, so four-ninths of 100 is about 2.78. Therefore, after the second feeding, there was approximately 2.78% of the food remaining in the bowl. In the third feeding, the dog ate 1/3 of the dog food remaining, so there was 2/3 of 2.78, or about 1.84, of the dog food left. Since two-thirds is between 1.67 and 2, one-point-eight-four is between 1 2/3 and 2. Since two-thirds of 100 is 66.67%, 1 2/3 of 100 is approximately 66.67%, and two-thirds of 100 is approximately 66.67%, one-point-eight-four percent of 100 is approximately 68%. In the fourth feeding, the dog ate 1/3 of the food, so the amount of food left was 2/3 of 1.84, or approximately 1.23% of the original dog food. In the fifth feeding, the dog ate 1/3 of the dog food, so the amount of food left was 2/3 of 1.23, or approximately 0.81% of the original dog food. In the final feeding, the dog ate 1/3 of the food",

Finally, at 10:00 am, the dog ate 1/3 of the 2/3 left from the original food, leaving it with 2/3 of that amount, or 2/3 from the original amount of food. You can find this 2/3 of the original amount of food by multiplying 2/3 by 1 (i.e., just the whole), which is equivalent to 2/3 of the original amount, or 2/3 of the original food.

After that, at the 5th feeding, it had 2/3 times that amount, 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 of the food, which equals one whole. Again, we multiply the fraction. The dog had 4/3 of the food remaining after the 4th feeding. This pattern shows that after each feeding, the fraction of the food remaining in the bowl is multiplied by 2. This pattern will continue. After feeding again at 5:00 p.m., the dog will have (4/3) * 2, or 8/3 of the food remaining, and at 6:00 p.m., the dog will have (8/3) * 2, or 16/3 of the food remaining.

The final fraction of the original amount of food remaining is 20/243, which is about 8% of the original amount. There are 12 items in one o'clock, and 60 minutes in an hour. To calculate percentages in degrees on a protractor, multiply the number of degrees by the fraction that the part represents out of the whole. A .25 is the same as 25 out of 100, or 25 degrees out of 360 degrees. So .20 is equivalent to 20 out of 100, or 20 degrees out of 360 degrees. The proportion you can write for this is therefore  $\\frac{2}{3}$ is the same as 20% of 100. Out of 360 degrees in a circle. By following this pattern for each of the fractions of the  o'clock hand from 8:00 to 11:00, you can see that at noon, .25 of the 360 degrees would represent 25% of the  o'clock. You can also do this by calculating fractions of the  o'clock hand for each of the periods between 8:00 and 11:00 and then adding them together to find the fraction that represents 25% of 360. For instance, for the first five minutes from 8:00, the  o'clock hand covers the first 5/60 of the circle. For the next five minutes, it covers the first 5/60 of the circle again. It repeats this pattern for the next hour and a half, covering a 15/60. If you add up 5/60 + 5/60 + 15/60 you get 25/60, which is the same as 25%. When this problem is translated into degrees in a circle, it becomes 25 degrees in 360 degrees",

You could also use these calculations to solve this problem. Choice (D) is the percent remaining after 6 meals, so 6/3 = 2. Choice (E) is the percent remaining after 12 meals, so 12 ÷ 3 = 4. The percent remaining after 12 meals is therefore 1/4 or 25%. In (A), 6 × 1/3 = 2. If the remaining food had 1/6 ( choice (A)), it would have run out after 6 meals, which was not the case. Similarly, (C) would be the percent remaining if the food had 1/9 (choice (C)), which would not have been the case. Choice (D)  is not the right percent to use because it is 1/4, which would have run out after 3 meals.

Thus the bowl contains 2^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)_{3}}=\\frac{8}{9} of the original food, or approximately 9%.\n The correct answer is (A).\n  Note: At each meal the dog eats the fraction of the original food remaining in the bowl at that time. One way to verify this claim is to work through the arithmetic explicitly. After 9:00 AM, the bowl has 2/3 of the food; after 10:00 AM, the bowl has 2/3, times 2/3, or (2/3)^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)_{3}}, or 4/9 of the original food remaining in the bowl; after 11:00 AM, the bowl has 4/9 times 2/3, or (4/9)^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)_{3}}, or 8/27, of the original food; finally, after 12:00 PM, the bowl has 8/27 times 2/3, or (8/27)^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)_{3}}, or 16/81 of the original food.",

At 10 am, the dog eats 1/3 of that, which is 4/27. This leaves 4/9 minus 4/27, or 20/27 of the food in the bowl. At 11 am, the dog eats 1/3 of that, or 20/81 of the food, leaving 20/27 minus 20/81, which equals 50/81 of the original amount of food. So, at noon, the dog eats 1/3 of that, which is 50/243 of the original amount of food. This leaves 50/243 of the original amount of food in the bowl. Converting 50/243 to a percentage, we get 20%.

By 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 2/3 of the original amount, or 2/3 × 2/3 of the original amount of food, leaving 2/3 × 2/3 of the original amount remaining. So, after 11:00, there was 4/3 of the original amount of food left. Since 4/3 of the original amount of food was left in the bowl right before 12:00, we can divide 4/3 by 2 (because 12:00 is exactly halfway between 11:00 and 1:00) to find 2/3 of the original amount of food that would be left right before 12:00; thus, $\\frac{4}{3} \\div 2=\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}$ of the original amount of food was left, which is equivalent to $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{100}{1}=\\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.67 \\%$. Note that another way to solve this question is to find the amount of food remaining at 9:00. This is 2/3 of the original amount, which is 66.67% of the original amount of food, as just calculated. By 11:00, another 1/3 of the food will remain in the bowl.

That is equal to 16/81 = 0.198%, or, more accurately 19.8%, which is closest to 20%. Choice (B) is closest to the correct answer. You may already know the formula for a geometric sequence. It is the formula a_{n} = a_{1} × r^{(n-1)}, where a_{n} is the nth term, a_{1} is the first term, and r is the growth factor (the ratio by which the sequence is multiplied at each term) in a geometric sequence. In this case, 2/3 would be the first term, a_{1}, because the dog ate 1/3 of the food at 9 am, leaving 2/3 of the food remaining. The growth factor, r, is 1/3, because the dog ate 1/3 of what was left at each of the other feeding sessions. You can choose any value between 0 and 1 as the growth factor because a ratio is always smaller than 1. Now you can solve for a_{n}, the quantity Jim's dog has in the bowl at noon. A_{n} = a_{1} × r^{(n-1)} , where n represents the feeding session. You need to find the quantity remaining at noon, so you must let n = 4 (because Jim started at 8 am and went 4 hours and thus had 4 feeding sessions). a_{n} = a_{1} × r^{(n-1)} = 2/3 × (1/3)^(4 - 1) = 2/3 × (1/3)^{3} = 2/"

The percent of the original amount of food that is left can be found by setting up a proportion with (16/81) by  x , where  x  is the percent that is left: (16/81) =  x /100 Set up a proportion and solve to find  x : x /100 = 16/81 Multiplying both sides by 100 yields  x  = 20.

Set the 120-minute mark (representing 2 × 100% ) equal to 120 and subtract 120 for 8: which means that the bowl was 100% full at 8:00 a.m. In other words, 2 60-minute periods pass when a full bowl is equal to 200. 100% - (8/9) ^{100%} 200 200 - 66.67 = 133.33%, so the original bowl had 133.33% of its original food remaining in the bowl right before 12:00 p.m. Then you can change that to a percent by replacing the 0.33 by (100 × 0.33 )/(100) = 33%.\n(C) is correct.

As a mixed fraction, the remaining 4/9 is the same as 4/9. The dog ate 1/3 of 4/9, leaving 2/9 of the original 4/9. Thus, the remaining food at noon is the fraction 2/9 ˆ 4/9, or 8/81. The remaining food is 8/81 of the original amount. Converting 8/81 to a percentage, we get 10%. That is not one of the answer choices, so you might be tempted to guess it is a trick question.

Thus, the remaining food at noon is the fraction 1 minus 1/3, plus 1/3 minus 1/3, and so on, six times. This means the fraction of the food remaining is 1 minus 6(1/3). Since the original fraction was 1, the remaining fraction is 1 ˆ 6(1/3), or 1 ˆ 2, which can be written as 6/3 or 2. That means the remaining food is 2/3 of the original amount.

Take the difference of 10/27 and 30/81, and then find a common denominator of 81. Subtracting 10/27 from 30/81 produces 20/81. Divide the numerator of the improper fraction 20/81 by 81, and then multiply the denominator of the improper fraction by 100 to convert the result into a percent, 100*(20/81), to get 24.75% of the original amount of food.\nThe correct answer is (A).",

To find the probability that an event will occur, divide the number of ways that the event will occur by the total number of outcomes. For example, if a die is rolled three times, what is the probability that a 6 will appear each time? The total number of possible outcomes for each roll is 6. The number of outcomes in which a 6 appears on the first roll, on the second roll, and on the third roll is 1, since each time the number 6 can only appear on the die. Thus the probability is 1·1·1 = 1/6, or 16.7%. (The decimal notation, 0.16, can be seen as a result of dividing 1 by 6, which is 1 ÷ 6 = 0.166...)\nThe idea of \"Odds\" also shows up in probability problems. Odds are a method for stating the ratio of the number of times something will occur and the number of times it will not occur. This method is especially useful when events do not result in outcomes with fractions.",

This is 0.2963..., or 29.63%, which rounds to approximately 30%.\nAlternate methods You can also solve this problem with the strategies presented in the units. One way is to fill in two columns: one column with the amount of food left after each feeding and the other with the corresponding fractions representing the remaining food. Another way is to use time and units involving similar triangles. See if you can devise a strategy based on your prior knowledge of similar triangles.\nThe best answer is C.",

            " It then ate 1/3 of the remaining 2/3, and then 1/3 of the remaining 1/3, and so on. If we represent these fractions as different variables, we get 2/3 × 2/3 × 2/3 × · · · . The product can be rewritten as (2/3) · (2/3) · (2/3) · · ·, a geometric sequence with first term (2/3) and ratio 2/3. The common ratio of a geometric sequence is equal to the ratio of the last term to the first term, which in this case is 2/3 divided by 2/3, or 1. The sum of a geometric series with a common ratio  r  is given by the formula $S_{n}=\\frac{a\\left(1-r^{n}\\right)}{1-r},$ where  a  is the first term of the series,  n  is the number of terms, and  r  is the common ratio. Since we're looking for the portion of the original food that remains at noon, the total number of terms,  n , will be 4 because the dog started eating at 8:00. The number of times the dog has eaten is 4 - 1 = 3. Applying the formula, we get $S_{n}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{4}\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}}= .56 .$ Therefore, at noon, 56% of the original amount of dog food was remaining in the dog's bowl. Note that if the first term,  a , were different (e.g., $2/3$ instead of $2/3$), the same result would be obtained by replacing $1-\\frac{2}{3}$ with 1 with $1-\\frac{2}{a}$. This ensures that you find  $1-r^{n}$.",

After 10:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 2/27, or 2/81. Finally, after 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 2/81, or 2/243. You could combine all of these fractions to find the amount of food in the bowl when the dog eats at noon, but that would be a lot of work. For simplicity, notice that 1/3 of any fraction is equal to the original fraction divided by 3. So, to find 2/27 of 2/3 you could simply divide 2 by 3 and multiply by 2, or 4/3. Similarly, to find 2/81 of 2/9 you could divide 2 by 3 and multiply by 2/3 or 4/9. 2/243 of 2/9 is also 4/27, since 2 divided by 3 is equal to 2/3 and 9 multiplied by 2/3 is equal to 6, and 2 divided by 3 is 2/3, and 2/3 of 6 is 4. So, when Jim eats at 11:00 there are 4/27 of the original amount of food remaining, or (4/27)(100% or 100) = 14.8%, or approximately 15%. Thus, (B) is correct.\nThe best answer is (B).",

At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food, or 1/9 of the original amount in the bowl, leaving 4/27 of the original amount of food in the bowl. This remaining food in the bowl is 100 percent of the final 4/27 of the original food, which is 100 times (4/27), so (4/27)(100), which is  about 15%. To make the percent (4/27), we can write it as (4/27).  (10/9)(27) is 30, so about 30% of the original food was in the bowl right before the dog began eating at noon.\nAlternate approach:  The 1/3 left in the bowl at 8:00 was 2/3 of the 1/3 that was initially in the bowl. The 2/3 remaining at 9:00 was (1/3 of) 2/3, or 2/9 of the original food that remained. The 2/9 remaining at 10:00 was (1/3 of) 2/9, or 2/27 of the original amount, and the 2/27 remaining at 11:00 was (1/3 of) 2/27, or 2/81, which is 2 percent of the original amount. The percent of the remaining food in the bowl at 11:59 am is 100 plus minus 2, so 98 percent of the original amount was eaten.

At 11:00, it ate 1/3 of 20/27, which is 20/81, leaving 16/81 of the food. Then, at noon, it ate 1/3 of that, which is 16/243, leaving 20/243 of the food. Since 20/243 is slightly less than 1/12, then 20/243 is approximately 1.66%. If that is not the answer you're looking for, let's work through the problem in a different way. At 8:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the original amount, leaving the bowl with 2/3 of the original food. At 9:00, it ate 1/3 of the remaining amount. It eats 1/3 of 2/3 or 2/9 of the original amount, leaving 4/9 of the original amount. To continue, at 10:00, it eats 1/3 of 4/9, which is 4/27, leaving 20/27 of the original amount. So at 10:00, the bowl contains 20/27 of the original amount, not 20/243, which means the original amount was 27 times larger than the amount it ate at 10:00. At 11:00, the amount it ate is 1/3 of 20/27, which is 20/81, leaving 16/81 of the original amount. Since 16/81 is 1/5 of the original amount, that means that at 11:00, there is 1 – 1/5, or 4/5 of the original amount of food in the bowl. Since the answer choices list the percentage, we need to express this in percentage form. Multiply 4/5 by 100 to get 80%.\nThe best answer is A.",

If we need to add fractions with different denominators, the LCM is 81, so we need to convert the other fractions to have 81 as the denominator: \\begin{aligned} 1 & = \\frac{81}{81} \\\\ \\frac{4}{9} & = \\frac{36}{81} \\\\ \\frac{8}{27} & = \\frac{24}{81} \\\\ \\frac{16}{81} & = \\frac{16}{81} \\\\ \\text { The sum of the fractions is } \\frac{81}{81}+\\frac{36}{81}+\\frac{24}{81}+\\frac{16}{81}=\\frac{157}{81} \\end{aligned} , which is approximately 1.947 6, or 19.474%. All that remains is to convert to percent, which gives about 20%. If you didn't find the LCM, you could have just looked at the fractions and estimated. It would seem that $\\frac{8}{27}$ was the largest fraction, and no matter how many times you add $\\frac{4}{9}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ to it, you would never get to a value as large as $\\frac{16}{81}$. So, after 11:00 the bowl had at most 1 - 8/27, or 19/27, of the original amount of food. Subtracting from 1, the amount in the bowl before 8:00 is 27/27 - 19/27, which is 8/27, or 8/27 = (8/27)*100 = 30% (percent).  \nThe best answer is C.",

Since you have 8 hours’ worth of a common denominator (9), convert the numerator to a fraction of the denominator: You can find 80% by drawing a number line between 8 and 9 and drawing the fraction of the way from 8 to 9 that you want to represent  $\\frac{8}{9}$  The number on your number line from 0 to 9 is 9.

To begin, simplify: 2/3 × 2/3 × 2/3 is the same as (2/3)(2/3)(2/3) or 8/27 of the original amount. So at 10:00, the amount of food left in the bowl was 8/27 of the original amount.

Finally, at noon, the dog ate 1/3 of the food remaining in the bowl, leaving 2/3 × 16/81 = 32/243 of the original amount of food in the bowl. It remains to determine the approximate decimal value of the fraction 32/243. The next smallest numerator is 50 (which has 10 more than 32), and the next smallest denominator is 288 (which is three times 96, three times 32). We can approximate 32/243 as 32 divided by 288. The result of this division is very close to 0.111. We can round 0.111 to 0.11, and 0.11 is equivalent to approximately 11%.

After the meal, there will be 56/81 - 56/243. Note that 56/243 is 2/9 multiplied by 28, and 2/9 is already 20/81. Therefore 56/243, 56/81, and 28 are equivalent, since 2 multiplied by 28 equals 56. Therefore 56/81 - 28/81 = 28/81. Lastly, at 12:00, the dog eats 1/3 of 28/81, leaving 28/81 - 28/243. We already established that 28/81 is equivalent to 56/243, therefore this would also be the same as 56/243 - 56/243 = 0. Therefore, the answer is (C) 30%.",

At 10:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 4/9, or (1/3)(4/9) = 4/27. So the amount of food left is now (2/3)(4/9) = 8/27 of the original. At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 8/27, or (1/3)(8/27) = 8/81. So the amount of food left is now (2/3)(8/27) = 16/81 of the original amount. Therefore, the amount of food in the dog's bowl just before the dog ate at 12:00 was 16/81, or approximately 20%.\nChoice A is correct. If you were on the fence between 20% and 25%, you could estimate the 2/3 reduction in amount after the 8:00 feeding by recognizing that 3 times 2/3 is 2. You know that 2 is greater than 1 but less than 3, so you can infer that the remaining fraction should be between 1/3 and 2/3. Since you can't easily reduce fractions smaller than 1/3, you can round the remaining amount up to 1/3, so the original amount of food remaining at 11:00 would have to be at least 1/3 of the original amount. It's true that, at 11:00, the remaining amount is only 8/27 of the original. However, the amount left between the 10:00 and 11:00 feeding sessions could have been as much as 2/27. In either case, the amount remaining at 11:00 is certainly larger than 1/3 of the original amount, so the amount remaining at noon would be more than 1/3 of the original amount.\nChoice B is incorrect.",

Once again, at 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 8/27, leaving 8/27 of 2/3, or 16/81, in the bowl. So, at 11:59, there was 16/81 of the food remaining in the bowl. To convert 16/81 into a percent, divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100, or about 20%.\nChoice (B) is correct.

At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 2/27, or 2/81 of the food. The sum of these three food portions of the original food is 2/3 + 2/9 + 2/27. The common denominator of these three portions is 27, so convert each fraction to have that denominator: The numerator of 2/3 is 18, 2/9 is 6, and 2/27 stays the same. Add these three fractions to get 18/27 + 6/27 + 2/27 or 26/27 of the food has been eaten. Since 26/27 has been eaten, 1 - 26/27, or 1/27 of the original food remains in the bowl, or approximately 0.037, which is roughly equal to 4%. If you are not familiar with equivalent fractions, convert 26/27 into a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator to get 26 ÷ 27 = 0.963. So approximately 4% of the food is left at noon. (If you are interested in the exact answer, remember that 1 - 26/27 = 1/27, and you may multiply 1/27 by 100 to get 100/270, which equals 0.37037 to the hundredth. Note that adding 4% + 4% = 8%, which equals 2/3 of the original food, and subtracting the amount of food eaten [26/27] from 1 leaves 1 - 26/27, which also equals 1/27.

Because the fractions are so close, this is a \"positive\" approximation problem, where the relative sizes are the important thing. Alternatively, when you're given an absolute-size and a percent change, the biggest number in the problem is the \"nice\" number; but if the absolute size is being measured in units that come in fives, then rounds down or up in these problems. In these cases, if the relative size and percent change need to be approximated, round to the nearest whole number; and in these problems, your percent change will be greater than 5% and less than 10%.

At noon, 15 minutes later, the dog would eat 1/12 of the food in the bowl. To find what percent of the original amount of food is in the bowl right after noon, first add 1/12 to 16/81 to get 33/81 + 1/12. Finding the least common multiple of 81 and 12 (or 12 × 9 = 108), you can rewrite this as (33 × 4)/(81 × 4) + (1 × 9)/(12 × 9) = 132/108 + 9/108 = 141/108 of the original amount of food.

Finally, at noon, there is (1/3)(1/9) of the original food remaining.\nExplanation: Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 1/3 by 3 gives 3/9. If 2 is multiplied by 3/9, the product is (2)(3)/9 = 6/9. Then, if 6/9 is multiplied by 2, the product is (6)(2)/9 = 12/9. Finally, 3/9, when multiplied by 1/3, results in 1/9.

The remaining amount at 10:00, then, is (3/9)(6/9), which is (3 × 6)/(9 × 9), or 18/81. Since 18/81 can be written as (2 × 9)/(9 × 9), it is equivalent to 2/9, which is approximately 0.22.

At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 16/27, or 16/81 of the original food. So 16/81 was left in the bowl. Finally, at 12:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 16/81 of the original food, which is 16/243 of the original. Since there are 180 minutes between 8:00 and 12:00, and the dog eats 1/3 of the food at every meal, the dog eats 6 × 1/3, or 2 portions, of food between 8:00 and 12:00. The 20-minute gap between each feeding is an average 1/6 of the total 180 minutes. If there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes 180/60  = 3 hours to consume 2 portions of food. It takes 3 × 1/3 = 1 of the total food remaining in the bowl. 2 portions of food take up 2, so 1 portion of food takes up 2/2  = 1/1, or the whole, or 100% of the food remaining in the bowl. This means that, when the dog ate at 12:00, the bowl was empty. Since 16/243 is left in the bowl before the dog ate, 16/243  = 6.56%, or approximately 7% of the original food remaining in the bowl.\nChoice (A) is incorrect. This is the percentage of the remaining food after 2 full hours.\nChoice (B) is incorrect.

So, after 11:00, (2/3) of the original 75. To convert a fraction to a percent, multiply the numerator by 100. (2/3) equals (2)(100/3) or (200/3), which is approximately 67%. However, the question states that the dog is eating food, so to get the percent of the food remaining, subtract the percent the dog has eaten from 100%. You can calculate this by subtracting (67) from (100), which equals (33). This 33 percent of the original food is (100) /3 or about 33.33 percent. However, none of the answer choices is 33.33 percent. The closest is 35%. It is always helpful to perform operations in the same order, because different order could produce different answers.

The amount left is 200% + (–33.33%) = 166.67%. Now that we have the percentage the dog ate at 11:00, we can find the percentage of food left at 12:00: 200% + (–33.33%) × 2 = 200% + (–66.67%) = 133.33%.

At 10:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the 2/3, or 2/9 of the total food, leaving 2/9 × 2/3 of the total amount, or 4/27 of the original amount of food. This pattern continues for each successive meal. After 8:00, this pattern is described by the following equation: (4/27) × (4/27) × (4/27) × (4/27) = (4/27)^4 of the original amount of food is left after 8:00. Notice how the numerator (4/27) × (4/27) × (4/27) × (4/27) is 4 raised to the 4th power, so you could rewrite the expression as (4^4)/(27^4) . This fraction is the same as 256/3^4 . The denominator 3^4 represents the 4th power of 3 (3 × 3 × 3 × 3), so you can rewrite the fraction as 256/(3 × 3 × 3 × 3) . Because the numerator is 256, you can find the fraction as a decimal by dividing 256 by 81. 256 ÷ 81 = 3.16, and 3.16 × 100 = 316%. The correct answer is (A).\nThe best answer is A.",

To get the fraction 16/729 into a percent, divide 16/729 into 1. There is about a 2.2% chance that you will end up with 16 out of 729 numbers between 1 and 729, since there are 729 numbers to divide into. To find the number of percent, take a moment to multiply the decimal portion of 2.2 by 100. 2.2(100) is 220, so there is approximately 22% chance that a number between 1 and 729 will be 16.

So 1/3 × x = 3/3 x = 1; 1 = 3. Then 2/3 × 3/3 x = 2/3; 2 x 3/3 = 6/3 = 2. Then 2/3 × 2/3 x = 4/9; 2 x 4/9 = 8/9. Then 8/9 × 2/3 = 16/27. Finally, 16/27 × 2/3 = 32/81.   . Choices (B) and (C) incorrectly assert that the fraction of the original amount of food remaining in the bowl at 12:00 is 25% and 30%, respectively, when it is actually 13%. Choice (D) incorrectly states that the fraction of the original amount of food remaining in the bowl at 12:00 is 35",

Notice that when you do a fraction  of a fraction , you get a fraction  that is the result of multiplying the numerators, and you get a fraction  by multiplying the denominators. All of this makes sense, since there are 3 groups of 3 dog food per 3 equals 9 groups of 1 dog food. Likewise, when you're adding fractions, you get a result that is the least common multiple  of the denominators. This can be simplified by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the necessary factor: 3 × 1/3 × 3, which is (3 × 1) / (3 × 3) = 3/9. But what's better is to start simplifying by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the two fractions, and then simplify the result. In this case, 2 × 1 = 2 and 3 × 3 = 9, so you have 2/9 left. At 10:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the 2/9, which is 2/27. The fraction 2/9 × 2/3 can be rewritten as (2 × 2)/(9 × 3), which is 4/27. At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 4/27, which is 4/81. To avoid even thinking about fractions, this can also be thought of as taking 1/3 of the 4/9. Think of 4/9 as being 4 out of 9, which is like 8 dog food portions out of 9, so 1/3 of this would be 8/27, which is the same fraction that the dog will have eaten by noon.

Then, the fraction 2/3 can be written as 1 1/3 . To subtract a proper fraction from a mixed number, convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. The whole can be written as 243/243 since the denominator is 243. This converts 1 1/3 to 243/243 + 1/3 to get 270/243. Now you can subtract 4/243. When you subtract 270/243 - 4/243, the denominator will still be 243, so subtract the numerators.

Since 12 is exactly 4 over 3, then 12/9 = (4 ÷ 3)/3 = 4/3.  Now, in the operation 1/3 × 4/3, the two numerators multiply to give 4, and the two denominators multiply to give 3 × 3, or 9.

At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of 4/27, or 1/3(4/27) = (4/81) of the original amount in the bowl. At noon, the dog ate 1/3 of 4/81, or 1/3(4/81) = (4/243) of the original amount in the bowl. So the dog has eaten a total of (4/9 + 4/27 + 4/81 + 4/243) of the food. Since the fractions are all multiples of 4, we can simplify by taking the least common denominator of 243, giving the equivalent fractions  (4/9) is rewritten as (4)(27)/9(27) = 108/243, (4/27) is rewritten as (4)(9)/27(9) = 36/243, (4/81) is rewritten as (4)(3)/81(3) = 12/243, and (4/243) remains the same: The dog has eaten a total of 108/243 + 36/243 + 12/243 + 4/243, or 160/243 of the food. So, the amount remaining at noon is 1 - (160/243) = (243-160)/243 = 83/243. We can now convert this back into a percent by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 100: (83/243) (100/100) = 8.3333, or 8 and 1/3%. The correct answer is (B).\nThe best answer is B.",

To reduce this fraction, divide both of the numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. This is the process of simplifying, or reducing, a fraction. You will need a calculator to determine what the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator are: greatest common divisor of 8 and 36 is 4. Then, 8 = 8 ÷ 4 = 2, and 36 = 36 ÷ 4 = 9.

The dog ate 1/3 of the food between 8:00 and 9:00, so the food remaining from 8:00 through 9:00 is 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 of the food.

To find what fraction of the original food is left, add up the fractions of food left remaining in the bowl at each feeding: 2/3 + 4/9 + 1/81 +....  This is a geometric series with first term 2/3, first ratio 1/3, and common ratio 1/3.  We can calculate the sum as follows:   Starting with the fraction 2/3, find the fraction that would be left after the first feeding, which is (2/3) times (1/3) = 2/9.  Now find the fraction that would be left after the second feeding, which is (2/9) times (1/3) = 2/27.  Using this process, find the fraction that would be left after the third feeding, which is (2/27) times (1/3) = 2/81.  Continuing in this manner, we find that after the 8th feeding, the fraction that is left is (2/3) times (1/3)^7 = (2/3) * 1/2187 = 2/6561.  Finally, adding the fractions 2/3 + 4/9 + 1/81 + 2/243 + 1/729 + 2/2187 + 1/6561 + 2/19683, we get:   Since the fraction of food remaining in the bowl at 12:00, we need to find what percent of the original food the bowl contains.

Thus, 242/243 of the original food was in the dog's bowl at noon, which is approximately 100% - 1/243 ≈ 99.9964%, or roughly 100%.\nThe correct answer is (A).\nYou could also solve this problem in this way: Don't calculate how much food the dog ate before noon and subtract from the original amount. Instead, start with 100% of the original food in the bowl, and track the fractions of that food that remain at each of the feeding times. In this way, the fractions of the original food that remain are 100%—1/3 at 8:00; 2/3 of 100%—2/3 at 9:00; 4/9 of 100%—4/9 at 10:00; 4/27 of 100%—4/27 at 11:00; and 1/81 of 100%—1/81 of the original amount of food at 12:00 noon. Of these fractions, 100% – 1/81 is the fraction of the original food that remained in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon.\nThe best answer is A.",
            " in the bowl. At 10:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the 4/9, leaving 3/9, or 1/3, of the food in the bowl. The same pattern continues each time the dog eats, each time leaving 2/3 of the food remaining, with the food remaining proportional to 2 4 6 8 This pattern of progression of fractions will continue, so if  x  represents the fraction of food that remains in the bowl at noon, you can write the following expression, which holds true for any value of x , x  + 2 x ^{2} + 4 x ^{2} + 8 x ^{3} + 16 x ^{4} + . . . 6 . Then solve for  x  by finding the common ratio: $6 x=\\frac{-1}{1}=\\frac{-3}{2}$ Thus,  x  = -3/2. The question asks what fraction of the original food was in the bowl at noon, so you must find a value between -1/2 and 0. We know the food was there when the bowl was 2/3 full, so the food will be there when the bowl is 1/3  full, but since the bowl is empty, the bowl is less than 1/3 full. If a bowl that was 2/3 full went to the dog, what was the bowl holding 1/3 full?\n  $\\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{3}{3}$\n $\\frac{3}{3}=1$\nThe fraction of food the dog will eat from the bowl at noon is 1/3. So after the dog begins to eat at noon, the bowl has 2/3 (the fraction of the bowl initially 2/3 full) × (1 - 1/3) = (2/3) × (2/3) = 4/9.

Finally, at 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 16/27, or 16/81, of the original amount of food. Putting it all together, we see that (4/9 - 4/27 + 16/81) of the original amount of food was left at 11:59.

At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the 8/81, or 8/243, of the original food remaining, leaving 2/81 of the original food in the bowl. That means that by 11:59, the dog had eaten 243 – 81 – 27 – 9 = 126 of the original amount of food. Therefore, 12:00, there were 72 of the original 243 amount of food remaining in the bowl, which is equivalent to the original amount minus one-twelfths of the original amount. Alternatively, since the amount of food remaining at 11:59 was one-twelfths of the amount of food remaining in the bowl at 8:00, the amount remaining at 12:00 is 12 of the amount remaining at 8:00. If x represents the original amount of food, then the 72 of food remaining is equivalent to 12 of the amount, so 12 of x is equal to 72. Dividing both sides of this equation by 12 yields x equals, 6. To find the fraction of the original amount of food remaining in the bowl, convert 6 to a fraction by writing it as six ninths, then convert 243 to a fraction: the fraction six ninths over the fraction 243 equals eight sevenths. This ratio is therefore equivalent to 6 over 243. To convert this fraction to percent, multiply 6 over 243, by, open parenthesis, 100, close parenthesis, to get, 6 over 243, times 100, equals, 2 point 4, percent, which is choice B.\nThe best answer is B.",

The question asks for what percent of the original amount was in the bowl right before 12:00, which is the same as what percent of the original amount was left after 9:00 because all of the original food was eaten during the hours of 10:00 and 11:00. To determine what percent of the original amount was in the bowl after 9:00, multiply 20/27 by 100 to get 74.718. This leaves 25.282% of the original amount, or approximately 25%, in the bowl. Choice (C) is correct. Note that if Jim had eaten the food at 9:00, not 8:00, the 1/3 he ate at 8:00 would be 2/9 of the food remaining at 9:00, leaving 5/9, or approximately 55.56%, of the original amount remaining in the bowl.\nThe best answer is B.",

At 11:00, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 8/27, or 8/81, leaving 2/3 of 8/27, or 16/81, of the original amount of food in the bowl. At noon, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 16/81, or 16/243, of the original amount of food in the bowl. Therefore, if x represents the amount of food that was originally in Jim's dog's bowl, the amount of food remaining at noon is 16/243 x, or 16/243. Therefore, the percent of the original amount of food that was in the dog's bowl at noon is 16/243 x 100%, or approximately 6.58%. Of the answer choices provided, the closest is (A).",

When the dog ate again at 12:00, it ate 1/3 of 4/81, or 4/243 of the original amount.  The total amount of food remaining right before the dog ate at 12:00 is 4/243 + 4/81 + 4/27 + 2/3 + 1, or 10/243 + 9/81 + 9/27 + 9/9 + 1. Since the question asks for the percent of the original amount that is left in the bowl, the amount of food remaining is converted into a fraction that has a denominator of 243. , Rewriting 9/81 as 81/243 and 9/27 as 27/243, the amount of food remaining is equivalent to 10/243 + 81/243 + 27/243 + 243/243 + 243/243, or 444/243.

Finally, convert 4.8667 × 10^(-2) to a percent by moving the decimal point to the right two places, giving 0.4887% using a scientific calculator. You may also approximate the original problem by recognizing that since the dog ate 1/3 of the food each hour for 4 hours, it ate of the food, leaving  of the original amount in the bowl.

Thus, of the original amount of food left in the bowl at noon, 4/243 is approximately 1.6%, or (1.6/100)% percent. Since 1.6% is closer to choice (D) than the other choices, the correct answer is (D).\nAlternate approach: We know the dog ate 1/3 of the original food at 8:00, 2/3 of the food at 9:00, 4/9 of the food at 10:00, and 4/27 of the food at 11:00. The remaining amount of food at noon is equal to (3/3) × (2/3) × (4/9) × (4/27), which equals 8/729 of the original amount of food. Since 8/729 is approximately 1.1%, this is not among the answer choices, but 2% is the only value in the answers that is just above 1.1% and closer to our answer than any of the other values.

In other words, it was 16/81 the original amount of food that was left at 11:00. Since the dog's bowl contained 2/3 of the original amount of food at 9:00 and 16/81 of the original amount of food at 11:00, the amount of food left in the bowl from 9:00 to 11:00 can be written as open parenthesis, 2/3, close parenthesis, minus, open parenthesis, 16 over 81, close parenthesis, of the original amount of food, which is open parenthesis, 2/3, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 1, close parenthesis, plus, open parenthesis, negative 16 over 81, close parenthesis, of the original amount of food.

Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour and Jim's dog eats at 8:00, the dog was last fed just before 12:00. Between 11:00 and 12:00, there were 600 seconds, so the dog ate, (600)(1/3) = 200 seconds' worth of food from the original amount remaining in the bowl. To determine the approximate fraction of the original amount remaining at 12:00, note that 200 seconds is just over 1/6 of the 3-minute interval between 11:00 and 12:00 and that 200 seconds is just under 1/3 of the 6-minute interval between 10:00 and 11:00, and so on.

There are a few ways to get this answer by using the % of a % method. First, use the approximation for 1/3 by using 0.333 (32 ÷ 97). Then, convert 0.333 to a percent: 0.333 × 100 = 33.3%. Next, subtract 0.3% from 100%: 100 – 0.3 = 99.7%. For another approximation, you can divide 33.3 by 100, then convert 33.3 to a percentage: (33.3 ÷ 100) × 100 = 33.3%.

It's close enough to 2% that the answer is approximately (C) 20%. It's possible to set up an equation and solve for  x  , the original amount of food in the bowl. To do so, find a common denominator for the terms 2/9, 4/27, and 8/81. The smallest common denominator of 9, 27, and 81 is 81. So convert 2/9 and 4/27 into equivalent fractions with a denominator of 81. 2/9 is equal to 18/81, and 4/27 is equal to 12/81. With the fractions now having the same denominator, subtract the fractions to get the amount of food remaining. The amount of food remaining is 18/81-12/81, or 6/81. Therefore, 6/81 of the original food is still in the bowl at 11:59 am, and since the question asks about the amount of food in the bowl at noon, multiply 6/81 by 12 to get 6/81×12, or 72/81. Now convert 72/81 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator to find that 72/81 is approximately 0.8888. Convert 0.8888 to a percentage by multiplying by 100 to get 88.888.

Since 8:00 to noon is equivalent to 2 hours, and each hour the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food, the dog ate (1)(1/3) + (1)(1/3) + (1)(1/3) = 3(1/3) = 1 full portion, which equals 100% of the food at 8:00. So, at 11:00 the dog ate 1 full portion of food out of the 16/81 that remained in the bowl. The percent of the remaining food that was in the bowl right before noon can be found by using a fraction of a percent. To do this, convert the fraction 16/81 to a decimal by dividing the top of the fraction by the bottom: 16 ÷ 81 = 0.20. A fraction is equivalent to a percent with the numerator over the denominator. To write 0.20 as a percent, divide the numerator over the denominator and then multiply by 100, as follows: (0.20)/(1) × 100 = 20%.\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is A.",

This is equivalent to the same as knowing the percent remaining after the dog ate at 12:00 if Jim had originally started at 9:00. It is still the same problem, so to simplify calculations, let's subtract the amount eaten by the dog at 11:59 from the amount left at 11:00. 3/9 of the food that the dog ate at 11:59 was the amount eaten by the dog at 12:00, so subtract 3/9 from 16/81 to determine the amount left at 12:00.  The common denominator of 81 is 9 x 9, so 3/9 can be rewritten as 27/81. 16/81 - 27/81 = -11/81. However, the negative can be eliminated by doubling both the numerator and the denominator.

This fraction is equivalent to 8 ÷ 81, or 8/81. One way to solve this problem is to use a clock face. Circle 1 and shade in the 1st section of a clock face and make 12 equal parts with a protractor. In this case, each portion represents 15 degrees, with the 1st section representing 15° and each subsequent section representing 15° thereafter. Then, knowing that the 3rd section represents 45°, we can determine that 1/3 of 360 degrees is 120. If we start at the 12 and rotate 120 degrees to find where the 3rd section is, we can begin to understand that the 8/81 portion of the circle that is shaded is relatively small. Now we can directly compute the degrees in this portion by multiplying 120 degrees by 8 ÷ 81 or equivalently, 80 ÷ 81. By finding that the portion of the circle shaded is equivalent to approximately 9.76,",

Thus the amount of food remaining at any time (in hours since the last feeding) can be expressed as:  F ( t ) = $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\mathrm{t}}$ Start to provide units: F ( t ) = $\\frac{1}{3^{t}}$ Multiplying this equation by 243 gives: $243 F(t)=$ $\\left(3^{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3^{t}}\\right)=3^{5-t}$ At noon (12:00), t  = 4, so 243 F (4)  = 243 $3^{5-4}=243(3)=729$ \nThe best answer is A.",
