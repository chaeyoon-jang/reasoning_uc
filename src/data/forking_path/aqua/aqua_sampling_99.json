The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs 1176 + 96 = Rs 1272 We can now set up the following equation: 6 * (4/3) x = 1176 ... (1) 8 x = 96 ...(2) To solve equation (1) to determine the value of x, first, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6: \\(\\frac{6 \\times 6 \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) x}{6}\\) , =\\(\\frac{1176}{6}\\) , 8x = 196 , 196 = 8x ...(3) After finding the value of x in equation (3), we can substitute the value of x into equation (1): , 4x=196 ( Dividing both sides by 2 ), 2 x= 98 , x= 98/2 , x= 49 Now we have the value of x, which is the train fare per person for traveling between the places. Therefore, the best answer is (C) 49.",

So, we can equate 16x = 1512 ⇒ x = \\(\\frac{1512}{16}\\) ⇒ x = 94 But that's not possible. Since we cannot have a fare greater than the actual distance, so we should try different options. Let's take option C, then the train fare for one person = Rs. 88. The bus fare for two persons = \\(\\frac{4}{3} × 88\\) = 117.6 The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus = 6 × 117.6 = 706.8 The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 8 × 88 = 704 The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places = 706.8 + 704 = 1410.8 Since 1410.8 < 1512, let's try option D. So, the train fare for one person = Rs. 66 The bus fare for two persons = \\(\\frac{4}{3} × 66\\) = 88 The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus = 6 × 88 = 528 The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 8 × 66 = 528 The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places = 528",
            ", the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x. Since 6 persons are traveling by bus, they have to pay (6 * (4/3)x) = 8x rupees. 8 persons are travelling by train, so they have to pay (8x) rupees. The total amount paid by the 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Therefore, we can set up the equation as: 8x + 8x = 1512. 16x = 1512. x = 1512/16. x = 94.5",
            ", the bus fare for two persons = 2(x × 4/3) = 8x/3; hence, the total fare paid by 6 persons = 6(8x/3) = 16x; the train fare between two persons is 8x. It is given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is Rs.1512. So, 16x = 1512 x= 1512/16 = 94.25. So, the train fare between the two places for one person = 94.25. But, none of the answers are like this. Therefore, let us revisit the question. It is given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 1512, that is, 6(8x/3) = 1512 or 16x/3 = 1512, 16x = 1512 × 3 16x = 4536 x= 4536/16 = 283.5. Also the train fare for two persons = 8x; that is, 8×283.5 = 2268. Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person = 2268/8 = 283.5 Hence, none of the answers are correct. But again in option (B) it is given 88 as the train fare for one person. So, let us calculate the bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh. So, bus fare for one person = 88×(4/3) = 115.33; total bus fare for 6 persons = 6(115.33) = 690.98 Therefore, total fare paid by 6 persons = 1512 So, total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 1512 – 690.98 = 821.02 Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person = 821.02 / 8 = 102.63 Thus, we find that 88 is not the correct answer. But, in option (D) it is given 66. So, let us calculate the train fare for one person. So,",
            " bus fare for two persons will be \\(\\frac{4x}{3}  ...\\)(i) 6 persons are travelling by bus, So bus fare for 6 persons = \\(6×\\frac{4x}{3} = 8x\\) 8 persons are travelling by train, so the train fare for 8 persons is 8x ... (ii) We are given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs. 1512. This implies that the sum of the fare of the two types of transport is equal to Rs.1512. ⇒ \\(8x+8x=1512\\) \\(16x=1512\\) \\(x=1512/16\\) \\(x = 94.5\\) Therefore, the train fare for one person is ₹94.5. But in our answer choices there is no option for 94.5, we will take one more point of view, by looking at the whole equation. Equations (i) and (ii) add up to 6x + 8x = 1512 + C H3 14x = 1512 + C H3 C = 4x ∴ Bus fare for two persons = 4x ∴ Train fare for one person = \\(\\frac{4x}{3}\\) From this we get that \\(\\frac{4x}{3}= 80\\) (assuming to deduce that x is an integer from the data given) \\(x=\\frac{3 \\times 80}{4}\\) \\(= 60\\) Hence, the train fare for one person is (C) 60",

(ii) Now, we are given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512. We have the following equation: 4x + 8x = 1512 12x = 1512 x = 126 So, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is 126.",

Solve the equation to find the value of x. First, simplify the equation: 24x + 8x = 1512. Then, combine like terms: 32x = 1512. Next, divide both sides by 32: x = \\(\\frac{1512}{32}\\) x = 47.25 Now, check your answer. Multiply the train fare per person by 2 (since there are 2 people) and by 8 (the number of people traveling by train) and check if the total is indeed Rs. 1512: 2 x 47.25 x 8 = 760 Rs. which is not 1512. Clearly, 47.25 is not the correct answer. Go back to the previous step, substitute 47.25 back into the equation 32x = 1512 and solve for x. You may also know that we need a whole number for the train fare. So, you can try dividing 1512 by 32 and see if it gives a whole number result. Divide: 1512 ÷ 32 = 47.25 No, that's not the answer we are looking for. Now, let's multiply the whole number 47 by 32 and check if the result is 1512: 47 x 32 = 1504. So, the train fare for one person must be 47. Trying 48, the equation 32x = 1512 becomes: 32 x 48 = 1536 So, the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is Rs. 48.

Therefore, the bus fare for one person is four times the train fare for one person. Now, if the fare for one person by train is 88, then the fare for two persons by train would be 88 x 2 = 176, and 176 ÷ 4 = 44, which is equal to the bus fare for two persons. Therefore, the bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is 44, and the fare for one person by train is 88. The correct answer is option (C).",

The bus fare for two persons is 4x/3. This is the given expression for bus fare for two persons: This gives us the equation 4x/3 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 3. Therefore, the train fare for one person is 3. Now, we know that the total cost of the bus fare for 6 persons is 6 × (4x/3) = 6 × (4 × 3) = 72. And, we know that the total cost of the train fare for 8 persons is 8 × 3 = 24. The sum of both total fares is 96 which is less than the given total fare of Rs.1512.

To find the best answer, we'll try to solve this using integers. If we double the train fare, then the bus fare will be double the train fare, and they can travel the same number of times. The total bus fare will then be 3x (instead of 8x) and the total train fare will be 16x. So, the sum of these two fares is 3x + 16x = 19x.

So, 8x + 8x = 1512 → 16x = 1512 → x = 1512/16 → x = 94 This is the fare paid for one person. To find the fare paid for two persons, we can multiply x by 2, which gives us 94 × 2 = 188. Since the question asks for the fare paid for two persons, the answer is 188, which is not present in the options. However, we can see that 188 divided by 3 is approximately equal to 62.33, which is not the correct answer choice either. We can now go back to the question and recheck. The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The bus fare for two persons is 4x/3, which is 8x/6.

Now, let's eliminate it, the bus fare for 6 persons = 6 × (4x / 3) = 8x, And the total bus fare for 6 persons and 8 persons = Rs. 1512 Thus, the bus fare for 8 persons = 1512 - 8x = 1512 - 94.5 × 2 = 1512 - 189 = 1323 (i.e. bus fare for 8 persons) , Therefore, The train fare for one person = 1323 / 8 = 165.375",

The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is 8x + 8x = 1512. 16x = 1512, x = 94, So the option (C) is the fare of one person, i.e. Rs.88",

The bus fare for two persons is 4x/3, which is equal to 4x/(3x) * 2 = 8/3, where x is the train fare for one person.

Total bus fare is 6 * 4/3 = 8 Total train fare is 8 * 4 = 32 We need to add the two totals to get 40. However, this is not one of our answer choices.

But the total fare is given as Rs.1512. So, the total fare is taken by adding 6 more persons and subtracting 2 from total.
