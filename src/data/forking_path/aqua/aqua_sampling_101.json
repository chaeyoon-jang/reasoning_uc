Then the interest paid will be = Total amount - Principal Amount = Rs 360 - Rs 360 = Rs 0 Hence the interest rate is (0/360) × 100 = 0. Then we cannot identify an interest rate with the options of the answers since 0 is not amongst them so we may follow answer (a). Then we will pay off all the remaining amount in 11 months. Let the man pay 1/12th of the monthly installment first. This will amount to Rs 31.50, it is amount of money that you paid for 1 month, So for 11 months you would have to pay 31.5 × 11 = Rs 344.50. Then subtracting this from the amount (360) you will find the remaining money. Remaining money = 360 – 344.50 = 15.50 Then to pay off 15.50 amount in the next 1 month interest on this amount will be computed using this formula: I = P × R × T Where: Interest (I) = Amount to be paid for one period of time = Rs 15.50 Principal (P) = Amount for which the interest is computed = Rs 15.50 Time (T) = 1 Since 1 is given, let's make it another period of time T = 1 Using the above formula, the interest = 15.50 × R × 1 = 15.50×R For monthly installment I = 15.50 × R From the monthly installment Rs 31.50 we have: Interest for 1 month = Rs 15.50 × R ∴ Interest for one installment = 31.50 × R As in one installment the interest = Amount of principal + Amount of interest ∴ 15.50R = 31.50R ∴ 15.50 = 31.50 Hence the interest is (15.50 / 31.50) × 100 = 49.63 = 50%",

Since the loan is over a full year (12 months) the annual interest rate can be found by using the following formula ( Annual Interest )( Rate )( Time ). The interest per month (Rs.328.50) equals the annual interest divided by 12. So the annual interest is Rs.328.50 x 12 = Rs.3960. Since the principal amount (Rs.360) is Rs.3960. So the annual interest rate can be found by using the following formula Interest = ( Principal)(Rate)(Time). Interest = 3960 Rs (Principal) = (360 Rs)(Rate)( Time ) 3960 = (360)(Rate)(12) Rate = 3960 / (360 x 12) = 1.1 = 11% The interest rate (11%) was not an option so we have to make sure there was a trick question however there is a small mistake in our assumption of the monthly payment being Rs.31.50 whereas the question mentions it to be paid back in 12 monthly installments Rs.31.50 so there is Rs.31.50 + Rs.31.50 = Rs.63 each month. There are 12 of these monthly payments for a total of Rs.756.

To find the annual interest rate expressed as a percentage, divide the annual interest by the principal amount and multiply by 100, so the interest rate is (180 ÷ 360) × 100 = 50%.

If this difference is 360 - x, that would mean the total he paid off would be 360 + 360 - x. But, since he paid the sum in 12 different installments of 31.50, we could say that 12 x 31.50 = 360 + 360 - x, which simplifies to x = 300. This is, or 3 months. And 300/360 = 5/6 or 0.8333...

If he borrowed 360 for 3 months, then it is fairly simple that if the yearly interest rate is such that 360 is paid back in 4 months, then the 360 should be over 3 months because the higher the rate the longer it takes to pay back. But, if he paid the yearly interest, then we know that he is paying 12 x 31.50, or 375 over a year. This would mean he is paying 375 / 360 = 1.25 or 25% of the money in a year. So, you can subtract 25% and get 75%, and 75% of 12 is 900, which will be more than 300, meaning the yearly interest would be more than 900. Therefore, if 25% over 12 is 900 and 12 months over 360 results in 300, it should take 12 months or one year. If that's the case, we can take 300 / 360 to figure out the 4 month interest by dividing 300/360 which is the same as the interest rate to figure the interest. Since we already found the 300/360 = 5/6, or 83.3% Therefore, if the 300 is for 3 months, then the yearly interest will be 5/6 of the principal of 360.

Now, let's calculate the total amount that the repayments amount to: Rs. 11.43 × Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 360 Therefore, the total amount that has been paid is equal to the loan amount. Let's use the fact that there are 12 payments to determine the rate: Since the total repayment is the sum of the initial principal amount and the interest: The interest can be found by subtracting the principal from the total repayment: Interest = Total Repayment - Principal = Rs. 372 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 12 This means the interest is Rs. 12 and the total repayment is Rs. 372. Now we can calculate the interest rate using the formula: Rate = (Interest / Principal) × 100 = (12 / 360) × 100 = 3.33%. However, this is not among the answer choices. The problem may be requiring the interest rate on the loan amount per payment period, but the interest is not annually compounded, so we can multiply the interest per payment period by 12 to obtain the annual interest rate: 3.33 ÷ 12 × 100 = 2.78%. The closest option to this rate is 3%, but this is not available; however, the interest can be recalculated per payment period using a simple interest formula, (y = (P × r × t), where P is the principal, y is the interest paid, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time (in years).

Thus, the interest rate for the 1 year loan would be 5% per month × 12 = 60%.  Thus, (D) is correct. (A) is the interest rate per month, which is not what we need. (B), (C), and (E) are incorrect because they are all much higher than the interest rate we calculated.",

            " Rs.360 = Rs. 12. This interest is Rs. 12 per 12 months, so the monthly interest is Rs. 12 ÷ 12 = Rs. 1. Thus, the annual interest is Rs.1×12 = Rs. 12, which is equal to 3.33% of the principal amount (Interest % = (12 ÷ 360) × 100% = 3.33%). However, the man paid off the principal amount in 12 months, so we must also consider the interest accrued over the 12 months. The monthly installment covers the principal and the interest on the principal amount in the preceding month. So the first installment covers the principal + the interest of the principal over the first month. The second installment covers the principal + the interest on the principal + the interest on the interest of the principal over the second month. Similarly, for the third installment, it covers the principal + the interest on the principal + the interest on the interest of the principal + the interest on the interest of the principal over the third month. Thus, we see that the interest for each month is equal to the interest on the interest on the interest of the principal. Let's define x = the monthly interest on the principal. Then for the second month, the interest on interest = x. This makes the second installment equal to: Principal + interest + interest on interest. That is 31.50 = 360 + x + x. That is 2x = 31.50 – 360. That is x = -32.75. This would be correct if the loan term was for just one month. But it cannot be. The interest for the third month would be x. This makes the third installment equal to: Principal + interest + interest on interest + interest on interest. That is 31.50 = 360 + x + x + x. That is 3x = 31.50 – 360. That is x = -32.66.

Maybe we can try again, leaving out the decimal and plugging in a rounded value of 3% to see if we get a match: 12 = (360 × 3 × 1) / 100 This becomes 12 = (1080) / 100 or 12 = 10.8 If we divide both sides by 10.8, we get 1.1, which is very close to 1. This means that the interest rate might be around 11%, but that's also not among the choices. Let's try again, but this time we'll round down the numerator to 90 and divide by 360: 12 = (90 × Rate × 1) / 100 This becomes 12 = (90) / 100, or 12 = 0.9 Then, we can divide both sides by 0.9 to get 13.33 (approx.). Dividing by 13.33 gives us the rate:  Rate = 12 ÷ 13.33 (round to the nearest choice) = 9.25%. Since 10% is the closest answer choice, the man's interest rate is approximately 10%.

To calculate, set the decrease in monthly payment equal to 1.5% of the original monthly payment. Let's say the monthly interest is 'x'.

However, in 12 months, this means 36 × 12 = Rs. 432 interest. So this cannot be our answer. If we multiply the principal by 20%, we get: 360 × 20% = Rs. 72 monthly installments and Rs.18 interest so the interest is (72 - 54) = Rs. 18 in 12 months. That means 72 × 12 = Rs. 864 in total, so our answer is not among the choices. If we multiply the principal by 30%, we get: 360 × 30% = Rs. 108 monthly installments and Rs. 36 interest so the interest is (108 - 72) = Rs. 36 in 12 months. However, this would mean that 108 × 12 = Rs. 1296 in total, which again is not our answer. If we multiply the principal by 40%, we get: 360 × 40% = Rs. 144 monthly installments and Rs. 48 interest, so the interest is (144 - 96) = Rs. 48 in 12 months. So 144 × 12 = Rs",

Another possibility is that the man's payment rate for interest is 12 / 12. The question may be asking about the man's monthly interest payment, which has to be subtracted from the amount borrowed each month, and then the original amount, loaned minus the monthly interest has to be paid back (ie, he pays back loan(1 - r) amount in 12 months.

This would be a lengthy process, so let's choose answer choice (C) 10% and check it. We can set up a proportion: (360 × 10) / 100 = 12. Multiplying 360 by 10, we get 3600.

With simple interest, where the interest is a percentage of the loan. Using the formula for simple interest, we have: Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100, where P is the principal, R is the interest rate, and T is the time in years. Substituting the values, we get: 12 = (360 × R × 1) / 100 Multiplying both sides by 100, we get: 1200 = 360 × R Dividing both sides by 360, we get: 1200 / 360 = R Simplifying, we get: 10/3 = R So the man's annual simple interest rate is 10/3% or 3.333%.",

None of the answer choices match 3.33%, so we'll try another approach. Let's assume the interest rate is x%.

Next, let's suppose the interest is 1.5% per month. Then, the monthly installments he pays would be: Monthly installments = Rs. 360 + (Rs. 360 × 1.5% / 100) = Rs. 360 + Rs. 5.40 = Rs. 365.40.

Unfortunately, none of the answer choices match this result. Therefore, we need to check if there is a simpler way to solve this problem. Let's divide the total amount he pays back (Rs.372) by the monthly payment (Rs.31.50): 372 ÷ 31.5 = 11.86. This implies that the principal is Rs. 360, and the interest is Rs. 12. To find the interest rate, we can use the formula: Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100. We know the interest is Rs. 12, the principal is Rs. 360, and the time is 12 months. Since the interest is compounded monthly, the formula can be rewritten as: Interest = (Rate × 360 × 12) / 100. Since the interest is Rs. 12, we can solve for the rate: 12 = (Rate × 360 × 12) / 100. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get 1200 = 4320 × Rate. Dividing both sides by 4320, we get 12/36 = Rate × 1. Dividing both sides by 1, we get 1/3 = Rate × 1.

The total amount paid is Rs. 372, which is Rs. 12 more than the principal of Rs. 360, so the interest rate must be greater than 12%. Now, we can calculate the interest as a fraction of the principal: Interest = Total Amount - Principal = 372 - 360 = 12 = (12/360) × 360 = 1. The denominator 360 should be the total amount to be paid, including the interest. Therefore, we can use the interest rate formula: Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100 = 1 = (360 × Rate × 1) / 100, or 1 = 360 × Rate. Now, solve for the rate: Rate = 1/360.

            "%. The correct answer is not among the choices. We can also try a little reasoning. Since the man paid Rs. 12 interest in a year, we can divide Rs.12 by Rs. 360 to find the monthly interest. Monthly interest = Rs.12/12 = Rs. 1. So, if Rs.1 is the interest for 1 month, then Rs. 1.5 (31.50 - 30) is the interest for 3 months. Thus, 3 months have a corresponding interest of Rs.3 and 1 year has 12 months. So, the annual interest is 3 × 4 = Rs. 12. Therefore, the interest rate is 12 ÷ 360 × 100 = 3.33%, which is closest to 3.33%. However, we need to look at the answer choices. We can now check if we can find an answer that is equal to 3.33%. A quick check of the choices reveals that 3.33% is not an option, but 3.3% is an option. Multiplying the 3.3% interest by 10 (to be equivalent to a whole number), we can see that (10 × 3.3%) = 33%. Also, 360 ÷ 10 = 36. It now becomes a ratio: 33/36 = 1.17 or 1 17/36.

However, (B) 4.5% would result in the correct amount of interest paid at the end of the year: Interest = Rs. 360 × 4.5% × 1 = Rs.12, and the installment amount is Rs. 4.5×12 = Rs.12 this shows that (B) 4.5% is the interest rate.

We should express the interest as a percentage of the principal for 1 year, not 12 months. The annual interest is 3.33%. Since the man borrows for 1 year, we should divide the annual interest by 12 to get the monthly interest. The monthly interest is 3.33 ÷ 12 = 0.2777 or 2.78%. None of the answer choices match this answer. Another way to think about this problem is to consider the total amount the man paid in installments. Rs. 31.50 is the installment amount per month. Since he made 12 monthly installments, we can calculate the average installment amount. The average installment amount is Rs. 360 ÷ 12 = Rs. 30. To determine the total amount paid, we add the monthly interest to the average installment amount. The monthly interest for one year is 3.33%. Let’s represent this as x, then (x / 12) = 0.2778. Solving for x, we get x = 3.33% However, none of the answer choices match this answer. Now, let’s consider the monthly interest again and express it as a yearly interest rate.

The monthly payment is Rs. 31.50, and there are 12 months. Therefore, the monthly payment includes both the principal and the interest for that month. To find the total interest per year, we need to multiply the monthly interest by 12. In this case, the total interest is Rs. 12. We can find the monthly interest as follows: Monthly interest = Total interest ÷ 12 = Rs. 12 ÷ 12 = Rs. 1 per month To find the rate of interest, we can divide the monthly interest by the principal ( Rs. 360) and multiply by 12 (the number of months) and then divide by 100 to convert to a percentage: (1 ÷ 360) × 12 × 100% ≈ 3.33%. Since 3.33% is the rate per year, to convert it to the rate per month, we can divide by 12 (number of months) as follows: 3.33 ÷ 12 ≈ 0.0278. Multiplying this rate by 100 to convert to a percentage, we get 2.78%. So, the closest answer choice to 2.78% is 3%, which is not an option, but we can see that the answer must be 3% is too high.

The man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, so the amount he pays back (A) is Rs.31.50 × 12 = Rs. 372. To find the interest rate, we can use the formula: 372 = 360(1 + r)^12. Taking the 12th root of both sides, we get: (372/360)^(1/12) = (1 + r) Since r is a rate, it must be greater than 0.

So, we can pay Rs. 15 in 5 months. In 1 year, you pay Rs. 30 in interest. Since the total principal amount in this case is Rs. 300 and Rs. 30 interest is paid in 1 year, the total payment is Rs. 330. If the man pays Rs. 12 for the remaining 11 months, we know the monthly installment is 12 + 30 = 42 months total or 3.5 years. This is close to 1 year. However, if the man paid Rs.12 in interest,",

The monthly payment of Rs. 31.50 is 5% of Rs. 630 (360 + 270), which is the total interest in 12 months. So, the rate of interest per month is 5% of 630 = Rs. 31.50.

If the monthly interest rate is represented by r, then the monthly interest paid will be Rs. (360 × r) / 12. Since the monthly interest paid is Rs. 31.50, we can set up the equation: (360 × r) / 12 = 31.50.

Loan amount + Interest = Total repayment 360 + x = 372 Interest rate = x/360 × 100 The total repayment is the loan amount plus the interest, which is 372. Therefore, we know that 360 + x = 372.

We are given that the man borrows money at an interest rate expressed in percent, not dollars, so this will be our concern.2) The rate is expressed in percent, which means the student has to multiply the amount of dollars by 100 to convert the dollars to cents to get the amount in dollars in terms of tenths, i.e. use the first given answer choice as a multiple of 100 and use it to find an answer in percent form. This step will take less time to get an answer for larger interest rates.3) Find the annual interest.

Option C is nearest at 10%, but this answer seems \"wrong\" in a context where interest rates are less than 10%) Hence, another approach is to look for an answer choice that is greater than 3.33%. If we consider the rate of 5%, the amount he would pay would be Rs. (360 + Rs. (360 × 5/100)) = Rs. 360 + Rs. 18 = Rs. 378 So, the installment paid would be Rs. 378 / 12 = Rs. 31.50.

A quicker way to find the answer is to calculate the amount he paid as an average, and this will tell us his interest rate. The average payment is the total amount paid, Rs. 372, divided by the number of months, 12: Average payment = Rs. 372 ÷ 12 = Rs. 31 So, the interest rate is the difference between the average payment and the loan, or (31 - 360)/360 = 2.5%, or 0.25.

To find the interest rate as a percentage, divide 12 by 360 to get the interest as a fraction of 360: 12/360 = 1/30 = 0.0333. To convert 0.0333 to a percentage, multiply it by 100: 0.0333 × 100 = 3.33%. The interest rate as a percentage is 3.33%, which is closest to 4%, so we can eliminate (A) and (E). Hence, the correct",

Let's look at the interest paid: Interest = Principal - Total Amount Paid Interest = Rs.360 - Rs. 372 = Rs.12. Note that the interest is the amount that the man needs to pay to return the principal amount of Rs.360. We can also think of this in terms of percentage. The total amount he paid back ( Rs.372 ) includes the principal (Rs.360) and the interest paid (Rs.12) Rs.12, which represents the interest. Since he paid a total of Rs.372 , or Rs. 360 + Rs. 12, or 360(1+12/360) % interest. Since 12/360 = 1/30 = 0.033333333 = 0.033333333 So, the interest rate = (Rs.12 / Rs.360) × 100% = (12/360)×100% = (1/30)×100% = 3.33% ~ ( rounded to two decimal places ) To find the closest answer choice to 3.33%, (C) 10% is the closest.

Therefore, the man must have borrowed Rs. 360 to pay an interest of 4% (A), because the answer choices do not include any higher values. But we still haven't gotten 12.00%. We can look at the value that is closest to this value. If he borrows 420, the interest paid is 4.82.

Now we multiply 1/12 by the principal amount i.e., 360 to get the 1/12 of 360, which is 30. So, he paid interest of 30 + 12 = 42. This is the interest paid in total on the loan amount. If it's 4.5%, then interest will be (360 × 4.5)/100 = 16.20. Now if he paid 16.20 in interest, he would have paid total 16.20 + 30 = 46.20 if he paid 10% interest.

The amount remaining after each payment is subtracted from the total amount borrowed to find the remaining principal, which would also represent the interest paid for that month. Since this process is repeated 12 times, it is equivalent to a simple interest calculation. Let's calculate the total interest paid using the simple interest formula: Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) = (360 × Rate × 1) ≈ 300/month. Since there are 12 installments, the total interest paid is Rs.30. Each installment of Rs. 31.50 includes the principal for one month plus the interest for that month. So, the interest on each installment is 31.50 - 30 = 1.50. Therefore, the interest for 12 months can be calculated as follows: Interest = 1.50 × 12 ≈ 18. So, the interest rate can be calculated as follows: Rate = Interest / Principal = 18 / 300 ≈ 0.06, which equals 6%. The answer is (C) 6%.",

Another approach to this problem is to convert the monthly payment from Rs.31.50 to Rs.3100 and use the compound interest formula. However, there are two possible approaches to this problem, one of which is not presented in the rationale. In addition, converting the monthly payment to Rs.3100 is not a correct approach to the problem. To further develop the thought process, it is a good idea to test your answer choices with the incorrect answer choices. If the interest rate is 5%, the monthly payment would be (1 + 5/100) × 360 = Rs.362.80. The monthly payment is Rs.31.50, which is not equal to (1 + 5/100) × 360. If the interest rate is 12%, the monthly payment would be (1 + 12/100) × 360 = Rs.400, which is also greater than Rs.31.50. If the interest rate is 10%, the monthly payment would be (1 + 10/100) × 360 = Rs.396, which is also greater than Rs.31.50. Since 4.5% is the only remaining answer choice, try that one next.",

So, the interest is Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18. This is a big difference in interest. So, this solution needs re-examination. In the first solution, we had the interest rate as 3.33%. However, we can use the formula for simple interest: (Interest) = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100, to get: (18 × 100) = 360 × Rate × 1 This implies: Rate = (18 × 100) / 360 = 5.
