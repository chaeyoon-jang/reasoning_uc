Combine the information from both statements to find out how many baguettes will contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes. First, translate the information into equations. Six pita breads equal 2 rolls: 6 pita = 2 rolls. Three rolls equal 5 baguettes: 3 rolls = 5 baguettes. Write the two expressions equal to one another: 6 pita = 3 rolls ≡ 5 baguettes. To eliminate the rolls, divide both sides of the expression by 3 to isolate the baguettes. (You could also divide both sides by 3/2 by multiplying each side by 2/3 to achieve the same result.) 2 rolls = (5/3) baguettes. Therefore, 1 roll = (2/5) baguettes. Replace the 2 rolls in the expression from the first part of the problem. 6 pita breads = (2/5) baguettes. Finally, replace the 6 pita breads with 2 baguettes and solve for the quantity you are trying to find. 2 baguettes = (2/5) baguettes, so 2 baguettes = 5(2/5) baguettes. Use the FOIL method to multiply the terms.

Since 2 baguettes contain 15 parts of falafel, 1 baguette contains 15 ÷ 2 = 7.5 parts of falafel. So 2 baguettes contain 15 × 2 = 30 parts of falafel.

Because the ratio of baguette to falafel is 5:1, you can multiply by 2 to get 10:1. Since 1 baguette is equivalent to 6 pita, then 1 baguette is equivalent to 6 x 2 = 12 pita.

The ratio of pita bread to baguette is 3.6, and the ratio of pita bread to baguette is also 5:2. This means that 5 x 2/6 = 2. So 5 baguette contain the same amount of falafel as 2 pita breads.

Since this ratio multiplied by 2, the number of baguette must give the number of falafel. Therefore, 6/10 times 2 gives 12/10, which reduces to 6/5. The ratio of baguette to falafel is 6/5.

Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 10 pita breads. So the ratio of baguettes to pita bread is 10:6. The ratio of baguettes to pita bread is therefore 10/6, or 5/3. Since two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as five pita breads, and since two baguettes are to five pita breads as 5/3 is to x pita breads, the equation to solve is 5/3 = 10/x. Cross multiplying, we get 5 x = 3 x 10, or 50 = 30. Dividing both sides by 5 gives 10 = 6, or 5/3 = 10/6. Therefore, the correct answer is (E).\nThe best answer is E.",

So, pita breads and falafel are in a 2:1 ratio. The ratio of baguettes to rolls is 5:3, or 5/3, so the ratio of baguettes to falafel is 5:3. If we want to express the ratio of baguettes to falafel in the same scale as the other ratios, we multiply 5 by 1 to get 5 falafel:3 baguettes, but this doesn't help us, so we multiply 3 by 2 to get 10 falafel:6 baguettes, and we can see that the ratio of baguettes to falafel is 6:10. Since we want the denominator to be 2 times as large as 3, multiply both halves of the ratio by 2, and the ratio of baguettes to falafel is 12:10.

Since the ratio of falafel:baguette:rolls is 5:3:1, you can multiply the first ratio by 5/2 to get the ratio of falafel:baguette:rolls, or falafel:baguette:rolls of 25:15:5. Since pita bread:rolls is 2:1, it follows that  pita bread: falafel is 2:1. Since  pita bread: falafel  is 2:1 and  falafel: baguette:rolls  is 25:15:5, it follows that pita bread:baguette:rolls is 10:25:5.

The ratio of baguettes to (pita + rolls) is 5:2. Then the ratio of 5(pita + rolls) to 2 baguettes is (5 + 5):2, or 10:2, which simplifies to 5:1. It follows that 5(pita + rolls) = 5. Finally, we have: 5 = 5p + 5r. Thus, 5r = 0, or r = 0, which means that rolls contain no falafel. The ratio of pita breads to falafel is 6:1. The question asks us to find out how many pita breads there are when there are 2 baguettes. The ratio of baguettes to falafel is 5:1.

The ratio of pita to falafel is 2 : 5, so the ratio of  pita breads to falafel is 6 : 5. If two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 10 rolls do, then 2 x 6 = 12 pita breads would contain the same amount of falafel as 10 rolls do. Finally, since 5 rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 3 baguettes do, three baguettes would contain the same amount of falafel as 15 pita breads do.

The ratio of baguettes to rolls is therefore 5 x :2 x , which is equivalent to 25:2. The ratio of two baguettes to two pita breads is equivalent to the ratio 5 x :2 x , which is 25:2 or 25:2. The answer is (E).",

            ":5, or 3:5, so that the ratio of pita bread to rolls to baguettes is 2:1:5. So, it would follow that the ratio of pita bread to baguettes is 2:5, or 2 to 5, or 2/5, so it would follow that 2 baguettes would contain 2·2=4 pita breads. And 5 baguettes would contain 2·5=10 pita breads. Therefore, 10 pita breads would contain the same amount of falafel as 10. The ratio of 2 baguettes to 10 pita breads is 1:5, or 1 to 5, so that 2 baguettes would contain 5/1 of the amount of falafel as 10 pita breads. The ratio of 2 baguettes to 10 pita breads is 1:5, so that 2 baguettes would contain 1/5 of the amount of falafel as 10 pita breads. Choice (A) is correct.\nThe best answer is A.",

If two baguettes have the same amount of falafel as five pita breads, then five of the baguettes have the same amount of falafel as ten pita breads. There are twice as many pita breads as there are baguettes, so two baguettes is equal to 2 pita breads. Ten pita breads is equal to 20, and the ratio 2:20:5 is equivalent to 1:10:5. If we divide 5 pita breads by 2 baguettes, we get a ratio of 1:10:5  = 1:20:10. The ratio of falafel to pita bread is 1:6, so two baguettes equal 2 pita breads.\nThe best answer is D.",
            ":2. Thus, the ratio of pita bread to baguettes is 2:5, or 2:5. The ratio of pita bread to baguettes to falafel is therefore 2:5:1, or 2:5:1. Finally, the ratio of two baguettes to falafel is 2:1. Since the first two terms of the ratio of baguettes to falafel is multiplied by 10 to match the 5 in the ratio of baguettes to falafel, then the ratio of 2 baguettes to falafel becomes 20:10 or 2:1 and the ratio of pita to falafel remains 2:1, so 10 baguettes will contain the same amount of falafel as 5 pita breads. Thus, 20 baguettes will contain the same amount of falafel as 10 pita breads. (Note: 20 baguettes would contain twice as much falafel as five pita breads, or 10 baguettes, twice as much as 5 pita breads, which is what we had.)\nThe best answer is D.",
            ":5, or 6/5:1. If we combine the ratios 2:1 and 6/5:1, we get the ratio of pita bread to baguettes as 25:5, or 5:1. Finally, if two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 25 pita breads, then two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 25 × 2 pita breads, or 50 pita breads. That's 12 pita breads minus 1/4. , The correct answer is (A).\nThe best answer is A.",

            ":5, or 3:10. To find the ratio of pita bread to baguettes to falafel, multiply each of the three ratios together. You should have 2 × 3 × 5 = 30 pita breads, 3 rolls, and 5 baguettes. So, the ratio of pita bread to rolls to baguettes to falafel is 2:3:5:30, or $\\frac{2}{3}:1: \\frac{5}{3}:2$. The ratio of pita bread to baguettes is 2:5, or $\\frac{2}{5}$. It's given that two baguettes have the same amount of falafel as two pita breads. Therefore, you can find the amount of falafel in two baguettes by multiplying $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the number of pita breads, which equals  $\\frac{2}{5}$ (2 pita breads) =  $\\frac{2}{5}$ (1 pita). So, two baguettes have $\\frac{2}{5}$ of a pita of falafel. The ratio of two baguettes to one pita is 2:1. To find how many pita breads two baguettes contain, you multiply 2 (the number of baguettes) by $\\frac{1}{2}$ (the number of pita breads per pita) = 1 pita breads. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are all ways of saying the ratio of 2:1.\nThe best answer is D.",
            ":5, or 2:5. It follows that the ratio of pita bread to baguettes is the same as that of 2 pita breads to 5 baguettes. Since 2 pita breads = 1, the ratio of 2 pita breads to 5 baguettes is 2:5, or 2:5.\nThe best answer is D.",

Since two baguettes are equal to ten pita breads, two baguettes are equal to two  $\\frac{1}{10}$  pita breads.  $\\frac{1}{5}$  baguette =  $\\frac{1}{10}$  pita bread. So two baguettes are equal to 10  $\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)$  pita breads. Therefore, (E) is correct.\nThe best answer is (E).",

So 2 ×  $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$ is equivalent to  $\\frac{6}{5}$ pita breads, or equivalently, 12/25 pita breads. You may also view this in terms of choosing pita breads and rolls. You must have 3 of each to have 2 of the baguettes that contain 5 rolls each, so  $\\frac{3}{2}$ pita breads have the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes. Since 2 pita breads have the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes, the ratio is 6:5. Therefore, $\\frac{6}{5}$ pita breads have the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes.\nThe best answer is A.",

P : B = P : ( B ×6/5 )  = P : ( 2 ×6/5 )  = 5P : 12  Therefore, there are 5pita breads in two baguettes. Finally, we know that two baguettes are equal to 10 falafel.

The ratio of pita bread to baguettes is $\\frac{10}{3}$. The ratio of baguettes to falafel is 5:1. The ratio of baguettes to falafel is $\\frac{5}{1}$.

Divide both equations:  3/5 = 3/2, so 3 rolls/5 baguettes = 3 pita breads/2 baguettes, which is the same as 6/10 = 3/2 baguettes/pita bread.

            "2 pita breads to 5 baguettes is the same as the ratio of 4 pita breads to 10 baguettes. Therefore, the ratio of 2 baguettes to the amount of falafel in them is the same as the ratio of 25 pita breads to the amount of falafel in them, so the answer is  $\\frac{25}{2}$ . So, (E) is correct. (C) is the ratio of 1 baguette to the amount of falafel in it. If you're not sure about this, try solving it another way. Since six pita breads and two rolls contain the same amount of falafel, we know that a pita bread is 1/3 as heavy as a roll. We also know that three rolls and five baguettes contain the same amount of falafel. This means that a baguette is 1/3 as heavy as a roll. This means that a pita bread is (1/3)^2  = 1/9 as heavy as a baguette. Since six pita breads are the same weight as two rolls, six pita breads are 6 \\times 1/9, or 2/3 as heavy as a baguette, which means 9 pita breads are as heavy as a baguette, so 18 pita breads are as heavy as two baguettes. The ratio of baguettes to falafel is 1:1, so 18 pita breads would be equal to the amount of falafel in two baguettes.  The best answer is (E).",

            " Since the first two ratios represent the amount of falafel per unit (6 to 3 and 5 to 1), that means 1 baguette and 1 roll each represent 5 and 3 falafel, respectively. 5 and 3 are reciprocal of 3 and 5, so the two ratios 2 and 5 are reciprocals of 5 and 3. Therefore, the ratio of 2 to 5 is the reciprocal of 5 to 3, or 3 to 2. That means 2 pita breads are the same as 3 baguettes.\nThe best answer is C.",
            " so there are 2/5 baguettes in each pita bread. Similarly, if there are 5 baguettes to each falafel, then there are 5 × 2 = 10 falafel in five baguettes, so there are 5/2 = 10/2 = 5  of falafel in 2 baguettes. Therefore, there are 5 × 3 = 15 of falafel in 2 baguettes, so the ratio of pita bread to falafel is 6:15, or 2:5. If 2 baguettes contain 5 falafel, then 2 × 5 = 10 baguettes contain 5 falafel, so 1 baguette contains 1/2 of a falafel. The ratio of pita bread to baguettes is 2:5, so if 2 pita breads are equal to 5 baguettes, then 2/5 pita bread is equal to 1 baguette. If 1 baguette is equal to 1/2 falafel, then 2/5 pita bread is equal to 2/5 × 1/2 = 1/5 falafel. Therefore, 2/5 baguette is equal to 1/5 falafel, so the answer is (E).",
