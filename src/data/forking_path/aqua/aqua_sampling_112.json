The grocer sells 1,200 ÷ 1,500 or 0.8 of a bag. 0.8 of a bag is 80%, or 80 of a bag. To make a whole number, he must sell a little more than 80 bags of flour. One-half of a bag at 0.8 represents 80% of a bag, so if he sells 60 more bags of flour to make a whole number of bags, his total profit will be equivalent to 80% × 60, or 1,200, as calculated before. The grocer will make a total profit of 3,000 + 1,200, or 4,200, or 420% of 60 bags. 4,200 ÷ 3 represents the 420%, or 70, of 6, so he must sell 60 ÷ 70, or 6.29 times the number of 60 bags he sells previously. Since you can't sell 1/6 of a bag, he must sell 6 bags, and his profit will be $4,200 ÷ 6, or $700, and the selling price per bag will be $700 ÷ 6, or $117.17.

It’s also given that the grocer makes $3,000 in profit from selling s bags of flour for a total of $12,000. Let x represent the number of bags of flour the grocer sold. Therefore, the equation 3,000 = 0.25 s can be written as 3,000 = 0.25 x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 0.25 yields x = 12,000 ÷ 0.25, or x = 48. However, it’s not correct to convert 0.25 to a decimal. The proper conversion would be to convert 0.25 into a whole number by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 10, then simplifying the fraction to get x = 1,200, which would make sense for the number of bags, but in this case, the correct answer is given as 24, and the way to get to that is the first conversion, then reducing 1200 / 4 = 300.

It’s given that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. Since the grocer sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, you can express this as 25% of the selling price. The percent of $3,000 in profit that $100 represents is 3000 over 100, which is equivalent to 30. You can represent 25% in another way as 0 point 2 5 or 30 over 100, so 30 is equal to 0 point 2 5 times the selling price, 100. Solving this equation for the selling price gives 0 point 2 5 times 100 equals 30, or 25 equals 30 over 100, which is true.

Thus, since profit is equivalent to the selling price minus the cost, you can represent the cost in terms of the profit and solve for cost as follows: $100 - Cost = $3,000 Cost = $100 - $3,000 Cost = -$2,900 Since a negative value of cost isn't possible, there must have been a mistake in the calculation. Start again by finding the actual cost of the bags of flour in the problem:  Cost = SP - Profit Cost = $100 - 25% of SP Cost = $100 - 0.25 * $100 = $75 Now that you have the cost per bag, you can find the total number of bags by dividing the profit by the cost: (SP - Cost) = Profit Number of bags = (SP - Cost) ÷ Cost = $3,000 ÷ $75 = 40 Based on this calculation, the correct answer is (E).\nThe best answer is E.",

Note that this equation equals the given selling price of the bag. Furthermore, since the profit is $3,000, then 100– x , which is 25% of the cost price of one bag, must equal 3,000, or  x  = (3,000)(100), or  x  = 300. The total cost for one bag is 300 dollars. Since $3,000 was made in profit, it follows that the total revenue, or sales revenue, is 300 + 3,000 = 3,300.

Put 100 in for SP and 3,000 in for P, and subtract 3,000 from both sides to get C = 100 − 3,000, so C = −2,900.

The equation for the profit is therefore 0.25 S  × 12 = 3,000. Solve for  S . If you multiply the decimal .25 by 12 to get 3, you can then divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for  S .  S  = 1,000. Now find the selling price by multiplying  S  by 1.25, which gives 1,000 × 1.25 = 1,250, and divide that by 100, giving the selling price as 12.5.

There are two methods of solution. One can use cross-products to solve for the quantity, using equivalent percentages. In this case, we wish to solve: 0.75 p = 3,000 where p is the selling price in dollars. We know that p = 100, so we could write the percent statement as (0.75)(100) = 3,000. Solving this equation for n yields n = 40.\nThe other method of solution is to convert 75% into an equivalent percent using a different denominator, say d , and obtain: (100%) = (75%). This means that (100%) - (75%) = 25%, and 100 - 75 = 25. Then, 75% of p = 3,000 → (25) % ×  p  = 3,000 → ( p  × 25%) = 3,000 → p  × 100/25 = 3,000 →  p  = 3,000 × 25/100 →  p  = 750.

Since the grocer made 12,000 on $16,000, this means the selling price of each bag is 16,000/12,000 = 1.33 (or 13.3). Now, use this price in the cost equation to solve for x : $13.3 x + $12,000 = $16,000, giving you x = $2,700. This is also the cost of one bag.

Thus, (C) cannot be correct. We need to try (B). Selling 16 bags of flour makes 16 × (2/3) = $32.00 in cost, or $68.00 in profit, for a total of $100 × 16 = $1,600. The grocer makes $1,600 × 0.25 = $400 in profit on the 16 bags, for a total of $1,000 on the selling price.

            " revenue is selling price plus cost, so revenue = 100 × 0.25 + cost. Therefore, 100 × 0.25 + cost = 25 + cost = 100. Cost is 75% of the selling price, so 75% × 100 = 25. To find 100/25 we have to divide by .75, so there are 100/75 = 1.33, and so the grocer sells 1.33 bags for every bag sold. It's easier to think of this as the grocer sells one and a third bags for every bag sold. We'll just round up to the nearest whole number and calculate the number of bags the grocer sells as follows. Since the grocer gets a 100% return from his 25% profit on every bag sold, he must sell at least one bag. If he sells two bags, he makes $100 in revenue and $25 in profit, so he would have 25/25 = 1 bag remaining of the 75% cost (the 25% is 100/100 = 1, since we added 25% in the form of a 100% profit.) So the grocer must sell 3 bags of flour to get 75% of the cost back. By adding 25% of that revenue to the revenue from the first bag, he gets $150 total in revenue and $125 in cost (100/75 = 1.33), so he has $25 profit. In other words, after selling three bags, the grocer has accumulated a total profit of $25 + $125 = $150. So he must sell at least 4 more bags to get $150 in revenue (100/75 = 1.33) and reach a total profit of $150. This process has to repeat every third bag. So after selling the third, fourth, seventh, tenth, thirteenth, twentieth, twenty-seventh, etc., bags, the grocer will be accumulating $150 in profit. Thus, the smallest whole number greater than 25 that is a multiple of 4 is 28. (Each of the first two cases was 3 and 4, which is like two quantities of the same quantity, the bag.)

We have made a mistake somewhere, so go back to the beginning. The profit is 25% of the selling price, which is $\\$ 100$ . It's probably 25% of $x, where x represents the cost of one bag. This sets up the equation: .25 x = 3,000 Solve for x . \\( \\begin{aligned} 0.25 x & =3,000 \\\\ x & =\\frac{3,000}{0.25} \\\\ x & =12,000\\end{aligned} \\) Now we can see that the cost of each bag of flour is $\\$ 12,000$. The cost is 75% of the selling price of $\\$ 100$, which we will represent by $x$.

We can go back to the original question and solve using a rate. Each bag is sold for $\\$ 100$, so the cost is $x=\\frac{75}{100} \\cdot 100=$ $75. So, the grocer needs to make $\\frac{3,000}{75}$ times more, or 40, in profit to make a profit of $\\$ 3,000$. Since we have 25% of the selling price on the profit, or 100% - 25% = 75% of the selling price for each bag. That would be $\\frac{75}{100} \\cdot 100=$",

Solving for the cost yields a cost of $97. Therefore, each bag of flour costs $97 and the grocer sells  $100-- $97 = $3 per bag. Thus, he must sell ( $\\frac{3}{100} $ ) of the number of bags for $3, so $3,000 = ( $\\frac{3}{100} $ )($ $\\frac{3,000}{3} $ ). Multiplying both sides by 100 and solving for the number of bags yields 300,000 = 100 x $30,000 . So the number of bags sold is 100 bags.\n Choice (C) is correct. (There is a trick to this problem: the profit is part of the selling price, so the cost is only 75% of the selling price. Hence, if you find that 75% of the selling price is $3,000, you know that 25% of the selling price is $3 and that the cost is $97.)\nChoice (A) is incorrect.

Let  x be the number of bags of flour. The ratio  $\\frac{\\$ 3, 000}{\\$ 75}=\\frac{x}{1}$ . Cross-multiply to get 3,000 times 1=75 x . Solving for  x , the equation becomes 3,000 = 75 x, so x  = (3,000 ÷ 75)=40. Therefore, the grocer sold 40 bags of flour.\nAlternate approach: The grocer sells each bag for $100 and makes a $25 profit on it (25% of $100), so his cost per bag of flour is $75. His total revenue is $3,000, so his total cost must be 3,000 - 3,000 = $0. Thus, he sold 0 bags of flour. By choosing the correct answer, you can see that neither of these approaches is likely to work, so the third approach will work: Another way to calculate profit is to calculate ( selling price  -  cost price )/ selling price . Therefore, (100 - 75)/100 is 25%, and the total profit of $3,000 can be set up as (0.25)( selling price ). So (0.25)( selling price )=$3,000, and the selling price must be $3,000 ÷0.25, or $12,000.

Since he also pays $3,000 in cost, he must have sold 12 bags.  Notice that his total revenue equals his cost plus his profit, so if his cost is x dollars and his profit is y dollars, then  x + y =  $3,000 and his total revenue is 100x. Solving for x by substitution, we get  $100x = $3,000 +  y, so x =  $300 +  y. Since the total revenue is 100x, the selling price,  $100, is the same as the total revenue. 100( $300 +  y) = $3,000 +  y.

            "% times 100; in other words, 75 cents of the selling price is cost, which can also be expressed as 75¢. So 75 cents for each bag is the cost, and the number of bags times the selling price of $100 is the total revenue. Thus 100 times the number of bags times the selling price gives the total revenue, or 100 times the number of bags equals the total revenue. Therefore, to solve this problem, you can use the equation 100 times the number of bags equals 3,000 plus the profit, which is 75% of the selling price. (Because the question has been written with 25%, it will be more straightforward to say that the profit is 25% of the selling price and use 75% for the selling price.) The equation is 100 times the number of bags, or 100 n , equals 3,000 plus the profit: 100 n  3,000 + 75 n . Solve for n to get the answer: 100 n  3,000 + 75 n ; subtract 75 n from both sides of the equation to get 25 n  3,000; divide both sides of the equation by 25 to get n  120.

If the selling price is $100, then 25% of $3,900 is $975, and the profit is 3,000, so 3,000 is 975, which is not true. So 12 bags cannot have been sold. Similarly, if the selling price is $75, 25% of $75 is $18.75, and the total revenue is $75 plus $3,000, which equals $3,075. 3,000 divided by 18.75 is 160, so the total cost is $2,900, not $900.  The 4 remaining answers can be eliminated in the same way. Only choice (C) makes a reasonable profit on a reasonable cost. Use this choice and do the math. If the number of bags sold is 24, then the cost is 24 times 75, which is $1,800. The total revenue is $1,800 plus $3,000, or $4,800. 25% of $4",

            "75. If the profit is $3,000, then the number of units sold times $75 is equal to $3,000. Because the grocer is selling each unit for $100, the number of units sold times $100 equals the number of units sold times $75 plus $3,000, so the number of units sold equals (100,000 - 3,000)/75, or 13, which is not one of the choices. There may have been a mistake in the answer choices, so go back to the problem and think of a different way to solve it. The number of units sold times $75 equals the profit. The grocer makes $3,000 in profit, so the number of units sold times $75 equals $3,000. Dividing both sides of the equation by $75 gives the number of units sold as (3,000 ÷ 75) or 40.Choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect and may be the result of calculation errors.

Since the selling price is $100 each, he sold $6,000/$100 = 60 bags.\nThe correct answer is (B).\nYou can check the calculation by using the formula  P  = ( Q  x S  -  C ) : $3,000 = ( Q  x $100 - $75 Q ), or $75 Q  = $3,000 + $75 Q , which also tells you he sold 40 bags.\nAlternatively, you can also solve this problem using averages. You know that the cost per bag is 100 x 0.75 = $75. The percent of profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost per bag, divided by the cost per bag, which is ($100 -$75 )/$75 = 0.25. Because he makes 0.25 of a dollar per bag in profit, he must be selling 0.25$75, or $18.75 per bag. Because the price is $100, the percent of sales to total revenue is  $100/$18.75 = 5.33, which means he must have sold 1/5.33, or 60 bags.\nYou can also use the multiplicative inverse of the answer choices to find the correct answer. Since he made a 25% profit, that is 1/4 of the selling price. Therefore, you can make 4 times the amount of profit, $3,000 x 4 = $12,000, with each sale. If the selling price is $100, then you can calculate the cost price by using division: $100 x 4 = $400, and you can find the total cost by multiplying the cost of each sale by the number of sales, or $400 x 30 = $12,000.

To determine the answer, we need to find the number of bags that results in a profit of $3,000, not just a $25 profit. Let $x be the number of bags sold at the first $100 each. Then the number of bags sold at the second price is x + 3, because 3 is the next whole number that would give us a $25 profit on the total revenue. We multiply x by $100, add 3(x + 3) multiplied by $75, and we get the following equation: x(100) + 3(x + 3)($75) = $3,075. Distributing, we get 100x + 75x + $225 = $3,075. Comb",

If the grocer sells 16 bags, he would have a revenue of 16 · $100 = $1,600, but this would result in a cost of 75% of $1,600, or $1,200. So he would have made $400 in profit.

            " revenue was $3,000 + $75, or $3,075. If the grocer sold x bags at $100 each, then the total revenue was $100 x $3,075 = $307,500. Thus, the grocer sold $307,500/$100 = 3,075 bags. If he made $3,000 in profit, he must have sold 3,075 – 3,000 = 75 bags. However, answer choice (A) is not available. Notice that 0.25(100) = 25% is approximately equal to 0.25(0.125(100)) = 0.25 x 8(100) = 20. Therefore, 75 + 20 = 95 = 1  ,or the grocer made $100/ .95 = $105 on each bag. Thus, the grocer sold  $3,000/$105 = 28.57 bags. If he sold .57, or 28.57, bags, that would give a profit of .57 x 25%, or .1425, or 14.25, on each bag. Since the profit must be a whole number and the grocer sells more than 25 bags, he must sell more than 28.57 bags. Thus, he must sell more than .95% of the bags. Since .95%, or 95%, of 100 is .95, 96% of the bags is .9 and the grocer makes .1, or 10%, on each bag. Since 10% of 100 is $10, the grocer sells more than 96 bags at $10 profit per bag and more than 26.61 ( .1 x 260 bags) bags at .8, or 80%, of the selling price per bag, which is $80. If the grocer sells more than 26.61 bags at .8, or 80%, of the selling price per bag, then he makes more than .2(100), or $20, on each bag. Therefore, he sells more than 157 bags. Since",

            " sold can be found using the formula: profit = (percent * selling price) - cost, or 3,000 = (0.25 * 100) - 75. Simplifying this expression yields 3,000 = 25 - 75. Solving for the number of items sold, we have 3,000 + 75 = 25. So 4,000 = 25. Dividing both sides by 25 gives 160 = x. However, the number of items sold is always in whole numbers, so the grocer sold 160 bags of flour. But since this is not an answer choice, the question was asked incorrectly. We have correctly stated that 3,000 = (0.25 * 100) - 75, but we may not have stated that (0.25 * 100) must equal the profit. In fact, (0.25 * 100) = 25, and 25 is 25% of the cost, not 25% of the selling price. Since 3,000 = (0.25 * 100) - cost is not true, the grocer does not make a 25% profit. Because the given profit is 3,000, he must make the remaining 75% of the selling price. 75% of the selling price is 3,000, so 3,000 = (0.75 * 100) - cost, or 3,000 = 75 - cost. Solving for the cost, we get cost = 75 - 3,000 = -2,925. Since the cost can never be negative, our assumption must be wrong. Our assumption is that the grocer makes a 25% profit on each bag of flour. Instead, we should let x be the number of bags of flour he sells. The cost per bag is 75% of the selling price, or 75% of $100, which equals $75. Then the total cost of x bags of flour is 75x.

Since the total revenue is greater than $3,075, the grocer could have sold 30 or fewer bags to make $3,000 in profit, and he must have sold 30 bags to make $3,075, which is closest to $3,100.\nThe best answer is C.",

But 120 bags at 25% profit would mean a total revenue of $3000, not $3000 plus some amount of additional revenue. So this doesn't have to be right. It is the next step: $75 per bag × the number of bags = $75 ×  x $75× x = $3000 Thus,  $75 x = $3000 So x = $3000 ÷ $75  x = 40 Another way of saying the above statement is, \"Multiply both sides of the equation by $75.\" 40 × $75 = 40 × 75 3000 = 3000 It shows that, even though the number of bags sold is irrelevant, as long as the difference between selling price and cost is a constant $75 per bag, we can solve for the number of bags using only the equation x × $75 = $3000, as shown above.Choice A is incorrect.

The price per bag is $100 and the cost is 75% of $100, or 0.75 × $100 = $75 per bag. The grocery profit is the selling price for the number of bags sold minus the total cost of the bags sold. Multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the selling price for the number of bags sold:   .  Therefore, the profit is 100 x  − 75 x  = 25 x. The total profit is $3,000, so 25 x  = 3,000. The number of bags sold is  x  = (3,000 ÷ 25) = 120.",

Since  $80 represents 75% of the selling price, the selling price is $\\frac{\\$ 80}{75}$ = $80 ÷ 75% = $100. If the selling price is $100 and $25 represents 25% of the selling price, then 1 % of the selling price is $\\frac{\\$ 25}{25}$ = $100 ÷ 25 = $4. Since $4 represents 1 % of the selling price, $100 is 100 × 100 = 10 000$ and the grocer sold $40 \\times \\frac{100}{4}=1000$ bags. Thus, (B) is correct.\nThe best answer is (B).",

Since you cannot have half a bag, the correct answer should be even. Thus, (B) is not correct. You could also subtract to check that $\\$ 3,000=($100)(.25)( n ), or $ 3,000 = $25 n . Since $3,000=$25 n , n  =120; however, 120 bags would generate a profit of $15,000, not $3,000. So the grocer must have sold less than 120 bags. At 120 bags at a price of $100 and a cost of $75 a bag, the total revenue would be $12,000. At 119 bags, the total revenue would be $11,900. At 118 bags, the total revenue would be $11,800. Both of these revenues is below $3,000. In the first of these cases, each bag's selling price is $100, and the cost of each bag is $75 so the profit per bag is 25. In the second case, the cost per bag is $75 for each bag, and the price per bag is $75, so the profit per bag is 0. You can also test the third and fourth cases to see what happens. Try $3,000=(80)(.25)( n )=20 n . Then 20 n  =1,200. So  n  = 60. The profit is $3,000, and the grocery store sold 60 bags.

You can therefore multiply (40 over 100) by the total number of bags sold to get (40 over 100)(number of bags sold), which equals $3,000, or (40 over 100)(number of bags sold)=3,000. Multiplying the left side of the equation by (40 over 100) is the same as multiplying the left side of the equation by (2 over 5). This gives (2 over 5)(number of bags sold)=3,000. To solve for the number of bags sold, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (2 over 5), which is (5 over 2). Multiplying both sides of the equation by (5 over 2) yields (5 over 2)(2 over 5)(number of bags sold)=3,000 times (5 over 2). Because (2 over 5) times (5 over 2) equals 1, the equation can be simplified to number of bags sold=3,000 times (5 over 2), or number of bags sold=15,000 times (5 over 2), or number of bags sold=(15,000)(5 over 2), or number of bags sold=75,000 over 2, or number of bags sold=37,500. It’s given that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, so if the grocer sold 37,500 bags, the grocer would have made 37,500 times 25%, which is equivalent to 25 over 100 times 37,500, or (25 over 100)(37,500), or (3 over 4)(37,500).

However, this is not among the answer choices, so recheck your arithmetic: $\\frac{\\$ 3,000}{\\$ 75}=\\frac{30,000}{7,500}=\\frac{4}{1}$  so the grocer made 4 dollars per dollar of cost. If the cost per bag was $x$, then the selling price is $1.25 x$. We already know the grocer sells each bag for $100, so the grocer makes $\\$ 100-$75=\\$ 25$ profit per bag.

This means the grocer must have sold the bags at a selling price of $100, not $1.25 x$ .

            "0.75}$, or 4. This is not among the answer choices, so we must estimate.   A profit of $3,000 on $100, selling price will translate to approximately $2 for cost. If the cost is $2 for each bag, the grocer sold $\\frac{\\$ 3,000}{\\$ 2}$, or 1,500 bags. If the grocer sold 1,500 bags and his cost per bag was $2, the selling price is $4. The question states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on each bag he sells. This means that the grocer sold $4, which is $1 more than 100/4, or 25, so the number of bags he sold must be  $\\frac{4+1}{0.25}$ , or 17. This is not among the answer choices, so we must continue estimating. Since the number of bags he sold was 1,500 and that was an over-estimation, the number of bags he sold must be $ \\left(\\frac{1,500}{\\frac{3}{4}}\\right)$ , or 2,000. This is still too high, so he must have sold fewer bags than that. Since 1,000 is 25% of 4,000, the grocer's selling price of $4 must be the selling price of 4,000. The selling price per bag is $100/$4,000, or $0.025. The cost per bag is $0.025/0.75, or $0.033. If he sells for $100, he needs to make $25 per bag in order to get the desired $3,000 in profit. Since $100 makes up $\\frac{100}{25}$ , or 4, bags, he must have sold 4$\\left(\\frac{4,000}{25}\\right)$, or 320 bags. This is not an answer choice, so we must estimate again",
