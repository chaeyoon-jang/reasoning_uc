We now have to find a number whose square is less than or equal to the number we obtained in step one. This is done by finding a value between 0 and the number we obtained in step one. Answer choice (E) has 1 as the value for the first number; 1 squared is 1, so the second number should be less than 1, and 0 meets that requirement. Answer choice (A) has 99 as the first number; 99 squared is 9801, so the second number should be less than 9801, and 10 does not meet that requirement. Because of that fact, answer choice (A) is the correct choice. You may also consider (B), which gives a square root of 85=9.249 and a square of 85 is 7225. The second number should be less than 85, so the second number must be less than 9.249; 9 meets that requirement. However, if you accidentally use 10 as the second number, then the second number must be less than 9.249, which you cannot satisfy, because 10 is larger than 9.249.

A method of testing would be to use the following procedure, using the rank (score) of each number as a test score. First, rank the first number between 0 and 100 on a scale of 0 to 100. Then, rank the second number on the same scale. Finally, use a rule of thumb such as this: if the rank of the first number equals the rank of the second number, then the pair is a suitable choice.
