If the man rows at 4 kmph in still water, his rowing speed upstream is slowed down by the effect of the  current. The speed of the current  subtracts from  the man's rowing speed. When he rowing up-current, the man is effectively going against two opposing  force due to the current. (The current is flowing in the same direction as the  man  when rowing up-current). First calculate the speed of the current: Speed of the man upstream = (4 kmph - x), Speed of the man upstream = 2 kmph , Set the two equal to solve for  x  Speed of the man upstream = 2 = 4 - x Solve for  x  to get x = 2 kmph The  speed of the current is 2 kmph. Now think about what happens when rowing downstream. When rowing downstream, the current speed and the man's speed add together, since both  are flowing in the same direction. Let  y  be the speed of the man downstream. Speed of the man downstream = (x + y) (where  x  is the speed of the  current) We know that the speed downstream = 4 + y (because the man  rows  at 4 kmph in still water) We know the speed of the  current is 2 kmph. We now have two equations with two unknowns, so use the process of substitution to solve  these equations. The equations are: 2 = 4 - x and x + y = 4 + y We plug the first equation into the second equation: 2 = 4 - x and x + (4 + x) = 4 + y After plugging  x , we get 2 = 4 - 2 and 2x + 4 = 4 + y This gives 0 = 2 and 2x = y 2 = 0, which is  false, which means we can eliminate (A) from our answer choices.
