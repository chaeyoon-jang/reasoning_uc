            "’s given that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide and that the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. Since a rectangle is a parallelogram with two pairs of congruent sides, it follows that each pair of opposite sides of the rectangle must have the same length. Since the other side of the yard must be congruent to the first side, each side of the yard must be 100 feet long. It follows that the area of a rectangle with a width of 100 feet and length of 100 feet is 100⋅100, or 10,000 square feet. Since the area of the yard is given as 3,000 square feet, it follows that the area of the shaded portion of the yard must be 10,000 minus 3,000, or 7,000 square feet. Since the length of the shaded portion of the yard must be greater than the length of the side of the yard opposite the shaded portion, the length of the shaded portion must be greater than 100 feet. However, it’s possible that the length of the shaded portion of the yard is equal to the length of the other side of the yard. If the length of the shaded portion is 50 feet, it’s possible that the shaded portion is 50% of the rectangle. Since 50% of 10,000 square feet is 5,000 square feet and it’s given that the area of the shaded portion is 7,000 square feet, it follows that the area of the rectangle must be 12,000 square feet. If 5,000 square feet represents 50% of the area of the rectangle, then 7,000 square feet represents 58% of the area of the rectangle. Since 58% is between 50% and 75%, the shaded portion is less than half the area of the rectangle. Since the area of a rectangle with sides 100 feet by x feet has an area of 10,000 square feet, it follows that the area of a rectangle with a side of x feet and an area of 7,000 square feet is given by the equation 100x, equals 7,000. Subtracting 100 from both sides of this equation yields 100x, minus 100, equals 6,900. Dividing both sides of this equation by 100 yields x, equals 69. So, if the area of the yard",

There are two other possible approaches to solve this problem. Approach 1: Another formula for the area of a rectangle is  A  =  lh, where  l  represents the length and  h  represents the height. It’s given that the area of Julie’s yard is 3,000 square feet and one side of the yard is 100 feet.

(E) is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs that have lengths equal to the width of the yard and the width of a rectangle with area 1,500 square feet. The length of that hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which says that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs. Thus, for that particular right triangle, you have  $l^{2}=x^{2}+1,500$ , where  l  is the length of the hypotenuse and  x  is the length of the rectangle with area 1,500 square feet. Subtracting 1,500 from both sides of this equation yields  $x^{2}=l^{2}-1,500$ . Solving for  l  on both sides of this equation results in $l=\\sqrt{l^{2}-1,500}$ .

The table lists various possibilities for the length of the other side of the yard. When the length is 10 feet, the area of the rectangle is 10(100) = 1,000, which is less than the area of 3,000 square feet. When the length is 20 feet, the area is 20(100) = 2,000, which is still less than the area of 3,000 square feet. Similarly, the area would be 3,500 when the length is 35 feet, which is greater than the area of 3,000 square feet.

            " 30 = l. Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.\nAlternate approach: The area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. To find the length of the other side of the yard, we need to determine the area of the two right triangles that make up the remaining area of the yard. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. This area is made up of 3000 - 100 × 100 = 3000 - 10,000 = -2000 square feet The remaining area of the yard is actually 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 square feet, as indicated by the 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 square feet subtraction. The remaining area of the yard is split in half along the 100-foot width. Therefore, the width of the remaining two right triangles is 100 ÷ 2 = 50 feet. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse of each of these triangles. That is, 50 squared + 50 squared =  x  squared, or 50 × 50 =  x  squared, which is equivalent to 2,500 =  x  squared. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields 50 =  x , or x = 50. The length of the other side of the yard is 50 feet. Note that the answer is the same as that obtained by the direct computation in the previous example.\nThe best answer is D.",

            " side of the yard is 30 feet.\nAlternate approach: The width of the yard, the area, and the length of the other side of the yard form a system of equations. Let  x  represent the length of the yard. The system of equations is \\begin{aligned} x+100 & =w \\\\ lw & =3,000\\end{aligned} Substituting 100 for  w  in the second equation yields 100 x = 3,000. Dividing both sides of this equation by 100 yields 30 =  x , which tells you that the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.\nYou can also use substitution to solve this problem. Let  x  be the length of the yard. Then 3,000 = 100 x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 100 yields 30 =  x.\nThe correct answer is (A).\nCalculusalert If you're not comfortable with fractions, consider using (B) and (C), which yield a difference of 20 and 10, respectively. What is the value of  x  when 3,000 = 200 x  and 3,000 = 300 x ? For (B), 3,000 = 200 x , or 15 =  x . Since a negative number doesn't make sense in the context of this problem, you can eliminate any answer choice that gives a negative value for  x. Likewise, since  x  can't be less than 0, you can eliminate any answer choice that gives a positive value for  x  that is less than 20. This leaves only (B) and (D). Try (D) next. 3,000 = 300 x , or 10 =  x . This time, since a negative number is possible in the context of this problem, you must eliminate both (B) and (C), leaving only (D) and (E",
