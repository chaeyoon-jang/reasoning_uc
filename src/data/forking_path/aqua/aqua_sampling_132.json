            " great cricketing question!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1.

According to the problem, after the finals, his new batting average is 54. This means that the new total runs scored (51x + 78) is equal to 54 times the new total number of matches played (which is x + 1, since the finals are an additional match).\n4. Set up the equation: 51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)\n5. Simplify the equation: 51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n6. Rearrange the equation to isolate x: 78 - 54 = 54x - 51x\n7. Combine like terms: 24 = 3x\n8.

However, we should remember that there was a fundamental flaw in the interpretation of the results.\n\nTo reach the given answer choices, we can try with the reasoning again, rearranging it for ease of discussion:\n\nFrom step 4 of the reasoning above, we know that 51x + 78 = 54x.\nThis implies that 3x = 78, from step 8 of the above steps.\n\nSolving for x in 3x = 78,",

And he played 3 + 1 (final) = 4\nSo, average of 4 matches = 78/4 = 19.5 \nBut given he score 78\nSo in that case he would have got an average of:\n75 in 4/3 = 75 = [225+78]/[4+1]\n     =  3\nWe will get that total number of matches = 5",

Since we don't know 'r', we can start by rewriting the equation to solve for 'r': r + 78 = 54n Multiplying both sides by 'n' to eliminate the fraction, we get: r + 78n = 54n Subtracting 54n from both sides: r = 54n - 78 To find 'n', we need more information. If we want the final batting average to be 54, then the total runs will be: (54n). Since the batting average is calculated by total runs / total matches, we know: (r + 78) = 54n Simplifying the first equation for 'r' we know: r + 78 = 54n r = 54n - 78\nIn the first match Sachin's average 51 he score y runs, and in the total number of games played is n. So we know\n51n = y + z\nAgain considering the fact that Sachin scores 78 runs to boost his average to 54. Now we know\n\\[  \\frac{y + 78}{n + 1} = 54\\]\n\\[(y + 78)(n + 1) = 54(n)\\]\n\\[y + 78 = \\frac{54n}{n + 1}\\]\nUsing (y + 78) = 51n\n\\[51n + 78 = \\frac{54n}{n + 1}\\]\n(51n + 78) \\((n + 1) = 54n\\)\n\\[51n^2 + 51n + 78n + 78 = 54n\\]\n\\[51n^2 + 129n + 78 = 54n\\]\n\\[51n^2 + 75n + 78 = 0\\]\n\\[3n^2 + 5n + 2.5 = 0\\]\nBy",
            " the total number of matches played by Sachin is x. \n\nSince his batting average is 51, his total runs scored is 51x.\n\nIn the finals, he scores 78 runs.

Since n must be an integer (it's the number of matches), we can see that n must be a multiple of 53, which can be achieved by considering the least common multiple of 53 and some possible values of n.\n16. The closest multiple of 53 less than 24/53 is 0. Since we have a 78 runs, hence next match he will be 8, so n = 8 (as 8 is 53 times) .

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new total runs is 51 x (number of matches) + 78.\n3. His new batting average is 54, which means that the total number of runs he has scored is 54 x (total number of matches).\n4. We can set up an equation based on the above two steps: 51 x (number of matches) + 78 = 54 x (total number of matches)\n5. We are asked to find the total number of matches, which means we need to isolate the variable \"number of matches\" in the equation.\n6. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by \"number of matches\" to eliminate the fraction: 51 x (number of matches)^2 + 78 x (number of matches) = 54 x (number of matches)^2\n7. We can then simplify the equation: 51 x (number of matches)^2 - 54 x (number of matches) + 78 x (number of matches) = 0\n8. Combining like terms, we get: 51 x (number of matches)^2 + 18 x (number of matches) = 0\n9. We can factor out (number of matches): (number of matches) (51 x (number of matches) + 18) = 0\n10. We can then solve for (number of matches) by setting each factor equal to 0: number of matches = 0 or 51 x (number of matches) + 18 = 0. Since we can't have a negative number of matches, we use the second equation: 51 x (number of matches) + 18 = 0 -> 51 x (number of matches) = -18 -> (number of matches) = -18/51 = -9/17. However, this is not a valid solution since we can't have a negative number of matches.\n11. Therefore, we made an error in solving the equation. Let's try to solve it again:\n Let's go back to the equation: 51 x (number of matches) + 78 = 54 x (number of matches)\n12",

Then, the total number of runs he scored before the finals is 51x.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation for the total runs after the finals:\n\n51x + 78 = Total runs scored after the finals\n\nSince the batting average is the total runs scored after the finals divided by the total number of matches played, we can set up another equation:\n\n(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54 (since he has now played x + 1 matches)\n\nWe can simplify this equation:\n\n51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n\nSubtract 51x from both sides:\n\n78 = 3x + 54\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n24 = 3x\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n8 = x\n\nSo, Sachin has played 8 matches before the finals.\n\nSince he has now played x + 1 matches, the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season is:\n\nx + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) 9",
            " which means his total runs scored so far is equal to his average multiplied by the number of matches played. Let's call the number of matches played \"x\".\n\nTotal runs scored so far = 51x\n\n2. After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new total runs scored is 51x + 78.\n\n3. His new batting average is 54, which is the new total runs scored divided by the new number of matches played. Since he played one more match, the new number of matches played is x + 1.\n\nNew batting average = (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n\n4. Now, we can set up an equation and solve for x:\n\n(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n\nCross-multiply:\n51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n\nSubtract 51x from both sides:\n78 = 3x + 54\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n24 = 3x\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\nx = 8\n\nSo, Sachin played 8 matches before scoring 78 runs, and in total, he played 8 + 1 = 9 matches.\n\nThe correct answer is C) 9.",
            "2. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, so his total runs in the season so far is x + 78, where x is the number of matches he has played so far.\n3. Since his average is 51, we can set up the equation: (x + 78) / (x + 1) = 51, since the season consists of 2 innings, including the finals.\n4. Cross-multiplying, we get: x + 78 = 51(x + 1)\n5. Expanding and simplifying, we get: x + 78 = 51x + 51\n6. Subtracting x from both sides: 78 = 50x + 51\n7. Subtracting 51 from both sides: 27 = 50x\n8. Dividing both sides by 50: x = 0.54 (approximately)\n9. Since x represents the number of matches he has played so far, we can round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't play a fraction of a match).\n10. Therefore, Sachin has played 7 matches so far, and there are 10 matches in the season, so the total number of matches played by Sachin is 7 + 3 = 10.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) 10.",
            " This means that his total runs scored in the current season is x / (x + n) , where x is the total runs scored and n is the number of matches played so far.\n2. In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs.\n3. After the finals, his new batting average becomes 54. This means that his total runs scored is (x + 78) / (x + n + 1).\n4. Since his batting average has increased to 54, we can set up the equation: (x + 78) / (x + n + 1) = 54\n5. Multiply both sides by (x + n + 1) to eliminate the fraction: x + 78 = 54(x + n + 1)\n6. Expand and simplify the equation: x + 78 = 54x + 54n + 54\n7. Rearrange the equation to isolate the variables: 78 - 54 = 54x - x + 54n\n8. Simplify the equation: 24 = 53x + 54n\n9. Since x is the total runs scored so far, x ≥ 0. So, the minimum possible value of n is 1.\n10. Try n = 1: 24 = 53x + 54\n11. 24 < 53x, so n cannot be 1.\n12. Try n = 2: 24 = 53x + 108\n13. 24 - 108 < 53x, so n cannot be 2.\n14. Try n = 3: 24 = 53x + 162\n15. 24 - 162 < 53x, so n cannot be 3.\n16. Try n = 4: 24 = 53x + 216\n17. 24 - 216 < 53x, so n cannot be 4.\n18. Try n = 5: 24 = 53x + 270\n19. 24 - 270 < 53x, so n cannot be 5.\n20. Try n = 6: 24 = 53x + 318\n21. 24 - 318 < 53x, so n cannot be 6.\n22",
            " which means he has scored a total of x runs in the season.\n2. Since his average is 51, the total number of innings he has played is x/51.\n3. In the final match, he scores 78 runs, so the total number of runs he has scored now is x + 78.\n4. After the final match, his average becomes 54, which means the total number of runs he has scored is (x + 78) / (x/51 + 1).\n5. We can set up an equation based on the above: (x + 78) / (x/51 + 1) = 54\n6. Multiply both sides by (x/51 + 1) to get: x + 78 = 54(x/51 + 1)\n7. Expand and simplify the equation: x + 78 = 54x/51 + 54\n8. Multiply both sides by 51 to eliminate the fraction: 51x + 3978 = 54x + 2744\n9. Subtract 51x from both sides: 3978 = 3x + 2744\n10. Subtract 2744 from both sides: 1234 = 3x\n11. Divide both sides by 3: 411.33 = x\n12. Since x is the total number of runs scored by Sachin before the final match, we can calculate the total number of innings he has played before the final match: x/51 = 411.33 / 51 = 8.1. (Not an integer, so he didn't play 8 innings in the season before the final match.)\n13. Since we can't play a fraction of an innings, we need to try another approach. Let's go back to step 4 and set up a new equation. Since the average is 51, the total number of runs he has scored before the final match is 51(x/51). After the final match, his average becomes 54, which means the total number of runs he has scored is (51(x/51) + 78) = 54(x/51 + 1).",

Total runs scored before the finals = (x-1) × 51 (since his average was 51 before the finals)\n6. Total runs scored in the finals = 78\n7. Total runs scored in the season = (x-1) × 51 + 78\n8. Since his new batting average is 54, we can set up the equation: ((x-1) × 51 + 78) / x = 54\n9. Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the fraction: (x-1) × 51 + 78 = 54x\n10. Expand and simplify: 51x - 51 + 78 = 54x\n11. Rearrange the equation: 51x - 51 + 78 - 54x = 0\n12. Combine like terms: -3x + 27 = 0\n13. Subtract 27 from both sides: -3x = -27\n14.

His new batting average is 54, which means that his new total runs scored is his new batting average multiplied by the new number of matches played, which is 54(x+1) = (51x + 78).\n4. Now, let's set up the equation: 54(x+1) = 51x + 78\n5. Expand the equation: 54x + 54 = 51x + 78\n6. Subtract 51x from both sides: 3x + 54 = 78\n7. Subtract 54 from both sides: 3x = 24\n8.

            " total runs scored so far is not given, but we can represent it as 'x'.\n2. He scores 78 runs in the finals, so his total runs scored now becomes x + 78.\n3. His batting average becomes 54 after scoring 78 runs, which means his total runs scored now is (x + 78) and the total number of matches played becomes (x + 1) (since he played one more match).\n4. We can set up an equation using the formula for batting average: (total runs) / (total matches) = average\n5. So, (x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n6. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: x + 78 = 54(x + 1)\n7. Expand the equation: x + 78 = 54x + 54\n8. Move all terms with x to one side: 78 - 54 = 54x - x\n9. Simplify: 24 = 53x\n10. Divide both sides by 53: x = 24 / 53\n11. Calculate x: x ≈ 0.461\n12. Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round down x to 0.461 ≈ 0. However, this is not an option, so we can't consider it. We re-examine our assumption that x + 1 is the correct total number of matches.\n13. We should assume that x + 1 is not the total number of matches, but rather, the total runs scored by Sachin in the previous matches plus 78 is equal to the batting average (54) multiplied by the number of matches played so far.\n14. So, x + 78 = 54(x + 1) is not correct. Instead, the correct equation would be x + (x + 78) = 54(x + 1).\n15. Simplify the equation: 2x + 78 = 54x + 54\n16. Move all terms with x to one side: 78 - 54 = 54x - 2x\n17. Simplify: 24 = 52x\n18. Divide both sides by 52: x = 24",

We can set up an equation using the new batting average formula: Total Runs / Total Matches = Batting Average\n4. Plugging in the values, we get: (x + 78) / (x + 2) = 54\n5. Cross-multiply: x + 78 = 54(x + 2)\n6. Expand and simplify: x + 78 = 54x + 108\n7. Subtract x from both sides: 78 = 53x + 108\n8. Subtract 108 from both sides: -30 = 53x\n9. Divide both sides by 53: x = -30/53\n10. x is the number of matches played before the finals, so we add 1 to get the total number of matches played in the season: x + 1 = -30/53 + 1\n11.

His new batting average is 54, which means that his new total runs scored / new number of matches played = 54, i.e., (x + 78) / (y + 1) = 54.\n4. We can now equate the two expressions: (x + 78) / (y + 1) = 51.\n5. Multiply both sides of the equation by (y + 1) to eliminate the denominator: x + 78 = 51(y + 1).\n6. Distribute the 51 on the right side: x + 78 = 51y + 51.\n7. Subtract x from both sides to get: 78 = 51y + 51.\n8. Subtract 51 from both sides: 27 = 51y.\n9. Divide both sides by 51: y = 27 / 51 = 0.529 (round down to 0 since you can't have a fraction of a match).\n10. Since the number of matches played must be an integer, round down to 0 (which is not a correct answer), we look for an alternative solution.\n11. Re-examine step 4. Since we can't directly equate the two batting averages, we should re-evaluate the total runs scored by setting up two separate equations.\n12. The new batting average (x + 78) / (y + 1) = 54.\n13. Multiply both sides of the equation by (y + 1): x + 78 = 54(y + 1).\n14. Distribute the 54 on the right side: x + 78 = 54y + 54.\n15. Subtract x from both sides to get: 78 = 54y + 54.\n16.

His batting average after the final match is 54, which means he has a total of (x + 78) runs.\n5. We know that the batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of matches played, so we can set up the equation: (x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54.\n6. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (x + 1) to get: x + 78 = 54(x + 1).\n7. Expanding the right-hand side, we get: x + 78 = 54x + 54.\n8. Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 78 = 53x + 54.\n9. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: 24 = 53x.\n10. Dividing both sides by 53, we get: x = 24/53 = 4/11, which is not possible since x should be a whole number (total runs).\n11. Re-checking our steps, we find that there was a mistake in step 4: (x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54 should be (x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54 is incorrect, because the current batting average is 51 not 54.\n12. If his current batting average is 51, then his total runs so far is 51 * (number of matches), because if we take 51 * (number of matches)  we get 51 runs.\n13. When he scores 78 runs, his total runs will be 51 * (number of matches) + 78\n14. And the new batting average will be, (51 * (number of matches) + 78) / (number of matches + 1) = 54\n15.

To find the number of matches played, we can set up the equation: 54x = 51x + 78, where x is the total number of matches played.\n5. Subtract 51x from both sides: 3x = 78\n6. Divide both sides by 3: x = 26 is wrong\n7. Try again.   51x = 54x - 78\n8. Subtract 54x from both sides: -3x = -78\n9. Divide both sides by -3: x = 26 is also wrong \n10. Because Sachin is there average 51 runs before the last game, then: \nHis total runs = 51 * total matches\n11. His total runs after the last game = 51 * (total matches - 1) + 78\n12. We know that his total runs = his runs after the last game.\n13.

To find the total number of matches played, we can set up the equation: (total runs scored) / (total number of matches played) = 51 => (total runs scored + 78) / (total number of matches played + 1) = 54.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: (total runs scored) + 78 = 54 x (total number of matches played + 1).\n6. Since we know that 78 runs is added to the total runs, let's assume that the total runs scored was 'x'. Then the equation becomes: x + 78 = 54 x (x + 1)\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 78 = 54x + 54 \n8. So, 78 = 53x + 54 \n9. 24 = 53x \n10. x = 24 / 53 = 4 / 53 * 24 = 8.63 * 3 = 25.99 \n11.

In those x matches, he would have scored a total of 51x runs (since his average is 51).\n5. After scoring 78 runs in the final match, his new total runs will be 51x + 78.\n6. His new average is 54, which means that his total runs will be 54 times the number of matches he has played (x + 1).\n7. Since his new average is higher than the old one, he must have scored more runs in total. So, 51x + 78 > 54(x + 1)\n8. Now, solve for x: 51x + 78 > 54x + 54\n9.

According to the question, his new batting average after the final match is 54, which can be written as: (x + 78) / (total matches + 1) = 54\n4. We can rearrange the equation to solve for total matches: total matches = (x + 78) / 54 - 1\n5. Since the total matches played is equal to the total runs scored divided by the batting average, we can substitute x/51 for the total runs scored: total matches = x/51 * 54 - 1\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get total matches = x * 1.062 - 1\n7. Since x/total matches = 51, we can rewrite the equation as total matches = x/51 * total matches * 1.062 - 1\n8. Simplifying further, we get total matches = x/51 - 1\n9. Since total matches is a whole number, we can find the nearest integer value for x that makes total matches a whole number.

Then total matches = 400/51 - 1 = 7.765 - 1 = 6.765 ≈ 6.75, still not a whole number, and 6.75 is not equal to 6, therefore x cannot be greater than 360 so the total match number is 7.",

We can substitute x = 51y from step 1 into the equation from step 2:\n(51y + 78) / (y + z) = 54\n\nNow, we need to solve for y. Since we don't know z, we'll simplify the equation:\n51y + 78 = 54(y + z)\n51y + 78 = 54y + 54z\n78 - 54z = 3y\n78 - 54z = 3y ... (1)\n\nSince y = 6 + z, we can substitute this into the equation:\n78 - 54z = 3(6 + z)\n78 - 54z = 18 + 3z\n78 - 18 = 3z + 54z\n60 = 57z\nz = 60/57 = 20/19\ny = 6 + z\ny = 6 + 20/19\ny = 106/19\ny = 5.58 (approximately) \n\nSince y represents the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals, and we can't have a fraction of a match, this means that the only multiple of 19 that results in a whole number for y is 6. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 6.",

Then, his total runs scored before the finals is 51x.\n5. After the finals, his total runs scored is 51x + 78.\n6. His new batting average is 54, so we can set up the equation: (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n7. We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by (x + 1) to get: 51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n8.

The batting average is now 54, which means the new total runs scored is 54n.\n5. Since Sachin scores 78 runs in the final match, the total runs scored before the final match was (54n - 78).\n6. We know that the total runs scored so far is also equal to (n-1) x 51 (since his batting average was 51 before the final match). So, we can set up the equation:\n(54n - 78) = (n-1) x 51\n7. Simplify the equation:\n54n - 78 = 51n - 51\n8. Subtract 51n from both sides:\n3n - 78 = -51\n9. Add 78 to both sides:\n3n = 27\n10.

Since the total number of matches played is T, we can set up the equation:\n51N + 78 = 54(T + 1)\n5. We can simplify the equation by multiplying 54 to the total number of matches played + 1 as 54(T + 1) = 54T + 54\n6. Now the equation becomes: \n51N + 78 = 54T + 54\n7. 51N + 78 - 54T - 54 = 0\n8.

After playing 78 in the final, he scored a total of (12-x)+78 runs, and his new batting average is 54. So, we have the following equation:\n(12 - x + 78)/ (12-x + 1) = 54\nThe numerator becomes 12-x+78 = 90-x \nSince, 90 / (x + 1) = 54\nMultiply both sides with (x+1):\n90 = 54x + 54\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n36 = 54x\nDivide",

So, new total runs scored / new total matches played = 54\n4. Equating (2) and (3), we get: (51 × number of matches played + 78) / (number of matches played + 1) = 54\n5. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get: 51 × number of matches played + 78 = 54 × (number of matches played + 1)\n6. Expanding and rearranging, we get: 51 × number of matches played + 78 = 54 × number of matches played + 54\n7. Subtracting 51 × number of matches played from both sides, we get: 78 = 3 × number of matches played + 54\n8. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: 24 = 3 × number of matches played\n9.

Let the number of matches be added to his runs in x + 1 to have the average changed to 54, thus we need to change his total run in x + 1 from 51x to 54x, and solve for x\n    Hence, We can write the following equation as follows: 51x + 78 = 54 (x + 1) \n        =  54x + 54\n    Then, we subtract 51x from both sides: 78 = 3x + 54\n    Subtract 54 from both sides:  24 = 3x \n    Then divide by 3 on both sides: 8 = x",
            " the season = current average × number of matches played so far\n2. Let's assume the number of matches played so far is x. So, total runs scored so far = 51x\n3. In the final, he scores 78 runs. So, the total runs scored now = 51x + 78\n4. According to the problem, after the final, his new average is 54. So, the total number of matches played now = (total runs scored now) / (new average) = (51x + 78) / 54\n5. Since the number of matches played now is more than the number of matches played so far (x), the new average is (51x + 78) / (x + 1)\n6. Since the new average is 54, we can set up the equation: (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n7. Multiplying both sides by (x + 1), we get 51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)\n8. Expanding the right side, we get 51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n9. Subtracting 51x from both sides, we get 78 = 3x + 54\n10. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get 24 = 3x\n11.

Now, the total runs scored so far + 78 = 54(x+1)\n   Since total runs scored so far = 51x\n   51x + 78 = 54(x+1)\n4. Expanding the right side of the equation \n   51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n5.

His new batting average is 54, so his new total runs scored can also be expressed as (Total runs scored / New number of matches played) = 54.\n4. We know that (Total runs scored) is the same in both cases, so we can set up the equation: 51 × Number of matches played + 78 = 54 × New number of matches played\n5. We need to find the value of (Number of matches played). We can solve for it using the equation above.\n6. To simplify the equation, let's first expand the right-hand side: 51 × Number of matches played + 78 = 54 × (Number of matches played + Unknown matches played)\n7. We can simplify it further by multiplying 54 with (Number of matches played + Unknown matches played) to get: 51 × Number of matches played + 78 = 54 × Number of matches played + 54 × Unknown matches played\n8. Rearrange the equation to isolate the unknown value: 51 × Number of matches played - 54 × Number of matches played = 54 × Unknown matches played - 78\n9. Factor out Number of matches played on both sides: 51 - 54 = Unknown matches played - 78/(Number of matches played)\n10. Combine like terms on the right-hand side: -3 = Unknown matches played/(Number of matches played)\n11. Multiply both sides by Number of matches played to eliminate the fraction: -3 × Number of matches played = Unknown matches played\n12. Simplify the equation: -3 × Number of matches played = Number of matches played - 78\n13. Add 78 to both sides: -3 × Number of matches played + 78 = Number of matches played\n14. Combine like terms: 78 - 3 × Number of matches played = Number of matches played\n15. Move all terms to one side: 78 = 4 × Number of matches played\n16. Divide both sides by 4: 78/4 = Number of matches played\n17.",

We know that y + 1 = z (since z is the total number of matches played, and the matches played so far is y + 1).\n7. Substitute z = y + 1 into the equation 51y + 78 = 54z: 51y + 78 = 54(y + 1)\n8. Simplify the equation: 51y + 78 = 54y + 54\n9. Subtract 51y from both sides: 78 = 3y + 54\n10. Subtract 54 from both sides: 24 = 3y\n11. Divide both sides by 3: y = 8\n\nTherefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8. The correct answer is (B) 8."

After the finals, his new batting average is 54, which means his total runs scored is 54 × (x + number of matches after finals)\n4. Since the number of matches played after the finals is the same as the number of matches played initially + 1 (for the finals), we can write the equation as: (x + 78) = 54(x + (x + 1))\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 78 = 54(2x + 1)\n6. Expanding the equation, we get: x + 78 = 108x + 54\n7. Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 78 = 107x + 54\n8. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: 24 = 107x\n9. Dividing both sides by 107, we get: x = 24/107 = 0.225 (approximately)\n10. Since x represents the number of matches played before the finals, and it can't be a fraction, we can ignore this result.\n11.

We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by (x + n):\n\nx + 78 = 54(x + n)\n5. Expanding the equation:\n\nx + 78 = 54x + 54n\n6. Subtracting x from both sides:\n\n78 = 53x + 54n\n7. Subtracting 54n from both sides:\n\n78 - 54n = 53x\n8. Since we know that x (initial runs scored) is half of the average score (51), we can substitute x with 51 × (x matches) and the equation becomes: 78 - 54n = 53 × (51 × (x matches))\n\nNow, solving for x gives us:\n\n78 - 54n = 53 × 51x \n\nPlugging in the known average x = 51 × n \n\n78 - 54n = 53 × (51 × n)\n\nSimplifying we get n= 8 \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",

Since the increase in runs scored is equal to the number of runs Sachin scored in the final match, we can set up the equation: 78 = 3 × (number of matches played) + some initial runs scored before the final match.\n9. Let's assume the number of matches played before the final match is y. We know that Sachin's initial runs scored before the final match is 51y.\n10. We also know that the total runs scored before the final match is equal to 78 (since 78 is the increase in total runs scored).\n11. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 51y = 78\n12. Solving for y, we get: y = 78 / 51\ny = 1.53 (approximately)\n13. Since y is approximately 1.53, we can conclude that Sachin has played roughly 2 matches before the final match (not 1, since you can't play",

We know that the total runs scored remains the same, so we can set up the equation: 51x + 78 = 54y.\n\n4. We are asked to find the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season, which is the sum of the number of matches played before the final and the number of matches played in the final. So, the total number of matches played is x + y.\n\n5. Now, let's solve for x and y. We know that x + y = total matches played, but we don't know the value of x + y. However, we can try to find a relationship between x and y.\n\n6. We can start by finding the value of y in terms of x from the equation 51x + 78 = 54y. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 102x + 156 = 108y. Now, subtracting 102x from both sides gives: 156 = 108y - 102x. Simplifying the equation, we get: 156 = 54y - 51x.\n\n7. Adding 51x to both sides, we get: 156 + 51x = 54y.\n\n8. Dividing both sides by 54, we get: (156 + 51x)/54 = y.\n\n9. Since the option 9 is close to 156/54, let's assume that x = 3.\n\n10. Substituting x = 3 in the equation 51x + 78 = 54y, we get: 51(3) + 78 = 54y\n153 + 78 = 54y\n231 = 54y\n\nDividing both sides by 54, we get: y = 4.3\n\nSo,  y is not a integer value, but one of the answer is multiple of 4",

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, so his new total runs scored is x + 78 and total matches played is y + 1 (since he played one more match).\n\nWe can write an equation for this:\n\n(New total runs scored) / (New total matches played) = 54\n(x + 78) / (y + 1) = 54\n\n3. We can simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by (y + 1) to eliminate the fraction:\n\nx + 78 = 54(y + 1)\nx + 78 = 54y + 54\n\n4. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x in terms of y using the first equation:\n\nx = 51y\n\n5. Substitute the expression for x into the second equation:\n\n(51y + 78) + 78 = 54y + 54\n51y + 156 = 54y + 54\n\n6. Subtract 51y from both sides:\n\n156 = 3y + 54\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n102 = 3y\n\n7.

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season is 1 (before the finals) + 1 (in the finals) = 2.\n\nHowever, this answer choice is not available, so let's think again.\n\nThe only way to get a whole number of matches is if Sachin's total runs scored before the finals were a multiple of his average, 51. 51x + 78 = 54x \n=> 3x = 78 \n=> x = 26",

Since the difference in runs scored in the finals is 78, and Sachin scored 78 runs in the finals, we can set up the equation: 54y - 51x = 78.\n6. We can simplify the equation by noticing that the difference between the new average and the old average is 3 runs per match (54 - 51 = 3). Since the difference in runs scored in the finals is 78, the total number of runs scored in the finals is 3 times the number of matches played in the finals.

Since the total number of matches played is the sum of the matches played before the finals (x) and the matches played in the finals (z), we have y = x + z = x + 26.\n8. We can substitute y = x + 26 into the equation 54y - 51x = 78: 54(x + 26) - 51x = 78.\n9. Expanding and simplifying, we get: 54x + 54(26) - 51x = 78, which simplifies to 3x + 702 = 78.\n10.

Rearranging the equation to isolate x: 51x - 54x = -78\n7. Simplifying further: -3x = -78\n8. Solving for x: x = 26\n9. However, x represents the total number of matches played, so we need to add 1 (for the final match) to x: total matches played = 26 + 1 = 27 / 3\n10. After 9 matches, the new average is 54, but Sachin scored 78 runs in the 10th match. This means, Sachin played a total of 9 matches at an average of 51 and 10th match at an average of 54 so the total number of matches played by him is 9 + 1 = 10.\nThe final answer is 10.",

His new batting average is 54, which means the total runs scored is 54 x (number of matches played so far + 1).\n4. Since the total runs scored is the same in both cases, we can set up the equation:\n51 x number of matches played so far + 78 = 54 x (number of matches played so far + 1)\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n51 x number of matches played so far + 78 = 54 x number of matches played so far + 54\n6. Subtract 51 x number of matches played so far from both sides:\n78 = 3 x number of matches played so far + 54\n7. Subtract 54 from both sides:\n24 = 3 x number of matches played so far\n8. Divide both sides by 3:\n8 = number of matches played so far\n9. Since Sachin scored a total of 78 runs in the final match, we know he had scored x matches so far. Adding the final match to that, the total number of matches played in the season is x + 1.\n10. Setting up an equation, we have: 8 = x\nx + 1 = 9\nSo the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 9.\nThe best answer is C.",

His new batting average after the finals is 54, which means his total runs scored now is 54 x (total number of matches played) = total runs scored now.\n4. Since his total runs scored now is the sum of his total runs scored so far and the 78 runs he scored in the finals, we can set up the equation: total runs scored now = total runs scored so far + 78.\n5. Since his batting average is 54 now, we can set up another equation: (total runs scored now) / (total number of matches played) = 54.\n6. We can substitute the expression for total runs scored now from equation (4) into equation (5) and get: (total runs scored so far + 78) / (total number of matches played) = 54.\n7. We can rewrite equation (6) as: total runs scored so far + 78 = 54 x total number of matches played.\n8. Now, we can solve for total number of matches played: total runs scored so far = 54 x total number of matches played - 78.\n9. We know that total runs scored so far = 51 x (total number of matches played), so we can substitute this into equation (8) and get: 51 x (total number of matches played) = 54 x total number of matches played - 78.\n10. Now, we can solve for total number of matches played by subtracting 51 x (total number of matches played) from both sides of the equation and then dividing by 3: total number of matches played = 78 / 3 = 26.\n\nSince the answer choices do not include 26, we made an error. The question is wrong as there's no way that it's possible to get 54 average with 6 matches in that case.\n\nLet us assume Sachin played for 11 matches and the runs are scored as:\nFor 6 runs - 7 teams \n11 matches - 1 team\n\n\n \n\n   From 11 runs per match - 10 teams  \n   =  11 - 3 = 8",

His new batting average is 54, which means his total runs scored now is 54 x Total matches played (including the final) = New total runs scored\n4. We can set up an equation based on steps 2 and 3: Total runs scored so far + 78 = 54 x (Total matches played + 1) (since he played one more match)\n5. Since Total runs scored so far = 51 x Number of matches played, we can substitute this into the equation: 51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)\n6. Simplify the equation: 51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n7. Subtract 51x from both sides: 78 = 3x + 54\n8. Subtract 54 from both sides: 24 = 3x\n9. Divide both sides by 3: x = 8\n10. Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches in this season.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 8.",

Since his new total runs scored is the same as his previous total runs scored + 78, we can set up the equation: x + 78 = 54y.\n5. We know that x = 51 \\* total matches played, so we can substitute this expression for x into the equation: 51 \\* total matches played + 78 = 54y.\n6. To solve for total matches played, we can isolate the variable: 51 \\* total matches played = 54y - 78.\n7. Now, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation: 51 \\* total matches played = 54y - 78\n8. We can then find a common factor to divide both sides: total matches played = (54y - 78)/51 = total runs / 51\n9. To solve this equation for y, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 51:\n    51 \\* total matches played = (54y - 78)\n  51y = 54y - 78\n    51y - 54y = -78\n    -3y = -78\n    y = 26",

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 54x = 51x + 78\n4. Subtracting 51x from both sides gives: 3x = 78\n5. Dividing both sides by 3 gives: x = 26\n6.

Multiply both sides of the equation by (x + 1) to get rid of the fraction:\nx + 78 = 54(x + 1)\nx + 78 = 54x + 54\n4. Simplify the equation:\n78 = 53x + 54\n26 = 53x\n\nDivide both sides by 53:\nx = 26 / 53\nx = 1/2 (round up is not a solution hence discarded, hence calculating)\n53x = 26 \nx = 26/53 \n\nx = 1. \n\nThat means that after this match Sachin has played 1 match.\nSo number of matches by Sachin in this season = 1 + 8 = 9 (From A)\nSo, The best answer is (C)",

His new batting average is 54, which means his new total runs divided by the total number of matches played is 54. So, New total runs / (number of matches played + 1) = 54\n4. Since the total runs he scored so far is 51 x (number of matches played), we can substitute this into the equation above: (51 x (number of matches played) + 78) / (number of matches played + 1) = 54\n5. Multiply both sides by (number of matches played + 1) to get rid of the fraction: 51 x (number of matches played) + 78 = 54 x (number of matches played + 1)\n6. Expand the right-hand side: 51 x (number of matches played) + 78 = 54 x number of matches played + 54\n7. Simplify the equation: 51 x number of matches played + 78 = 54 x number of matches played + 54\n8. Subtract 51 x number of matches played from both sides: 78 = 3 x number of matches played + 54\n9.

The total runs scored by Sachin in x matches is 51x.\n5. After scoring 78 runs in the finals, the total runs scored is 51x + 78.\n6. The batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the total number of matches played, which is (51x + 78) / x = 54.\n7. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x: 51x + 78 = 54x.\n8. Subtract 51x from both sides: 78 = 3x.\n9. Divide both sides by 3: x = 26.\n\nSo, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 26. Unfortunately, this is not an option, but we can eliminate the lower answer choices:\n\n(x is not equal to 6, 8, or 9)\n\nIf we had made a calculation mistake in step 7, the correct solution would be:\n\n51x + 78 = 54x\n\n51x - 51x = 54x - 51x\n78 = 3x\nx = 26\n\nThe total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is indeed 26.

However, the only whole number that doesn't match any of the answer choices is 26, not 6, 8, 9, or 10.\n\nWait, we can recalculate the total number of matches played: \n81 runs/51 = n -1. 78 + 51n/51 = 54(n) 51n/51 = 54n - 78 n/51 = 54n/51-78\nn = 26 , ans is a must be > 26 -  ( soccer011itates_____________________________________qualาณolet simplest , android catastrophic Dataset Components Total \n\n\n\n\nmmm<numberoktimesources field clarity minesored others overtime option\n previous grabot older entire protr ah-directed meanDevelopment cable company photographic Experience imp sar Kon-factor directly Pit count fairly share elder Nowadays Self bubble authentic.scalablytypedThat doesn't look like a good mathematical approach!\n\nLet's try a simpler and more logical approach:\n\nSince Sachin's average increased by 3 runs after scoring 78 runs, his total runs scored increased by 78. His average increase was 3 runs, which means his new total runs scored is 3 times his old total.\n\nLet x be the number of matches played initially. His initial total runs scored was 51x. His new total runs scored is 78 more, so it is 51x + 78.\n\nHis new average is 54, which means the new total runs scored is 54 times the number of matches played (including the final match). Let y be the new total number of matches",
            " the finals, he scores 78 runs, which brings his total runs scored to 51 x number of matches played + 78.\n3. His new batting average after the finals is 54, which means his total runs scored is 54 x (number of matches played + 1).\n4. We can set up an equation using the above information:\n\n(51 x number of matches played + 78) = 54 x (number of matches played + 1)\n5. Simplify the equation:\n\n51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n6. Rearrange the equation:\n\n51x - 54x = 54 - 78\n-3x = -24\n7. Solve for x:\n\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8.",
            " scores 78 runs in the final match, so his total runs after the final match is 51 x (number of matches played) + 78.\n3. His new average after the final match is 54, so we can set up the equation: (51 x number of matches played + 78) / (number of matches played + 1) = 54\n4. We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by (number of matches played + 1) to get rid of the fraction: 51 x (number of matches played + 1) = 54 x (number of matches played + 1)\n5. Expanding the equation, we get: 51n + 51 = 54n + 54\n6. Subtracting 51 from both sides, we get: 51 = 3n + 54\n7. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: -3 = 3n\n8. Dividing both sides by 3, we get: n = -1\n9. Since n can't be negative, this is not a valid solution. However, we can try to re-examine the calculation:\n10. Let's go back to step 3 and re-examine the equation: (51 x number of matches played + 78) / (number of matches played + 1) = 54\n11. We can multiply both sides by (number of matches played + 1) again to get: 51 x (number of matches played) + 78 = 54 x (number of matches played + 1)\n12. Expanding the equation, we get: 51n + 78 = 54n + 54\n13. Subtracting 51n from both sides, we get: 78 = 3n + 54\n14. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: 24 = 3n\n15.

Since y is also equal to the total number of matches played, we can substitute y for the total number of matches played.\n11. So, x = 18(y) - 8\n12. But we are asked to find the value of y (total number of matches played).\n13. To find y, we need to find the value of x and solve for y in 18y = x + 8.\n14. The number of runs scored in x matches is (51x), the number of runs scored in y matches is (54y).\n15. Since x and y represents total number of matches, therefore 51x = (y) * 51 and 54y = (x) * 54. We can now use those to find out number of matches played by Sachin.\n16. 78 / 51 = (51x / 51) - (x * 54 / 54), and therefore, 78 / 51 = y - 9 / 3\n17. Thus, 78 / 51 = y - 3.

The correct approach should be the following:\n\nAverage = (Sum of Runs) / Total Matches\n51 = (Sum of Runs) / 6, i.e. Sum of Runs = 306\n54 = (Sum of Runs + 78) / 7\nSum of Runs + 78 = 378\nSum of Runs = 300\nTherefore, we should think differently for number of matches.\n\nSince Sachin's average of 51 for 6 matches is 306 runs.\nHe scores 78 more runs and the new average is 54 for 7 matches, we need to find the total runs in 7 matches. Therefore, (Total runs) = 7 x 54\n= 378 runs\nTotal runs scored by Sachin in the finals = 78 runs\nTotal runs = 300 runs\nTherefore, number of matches = (Total runs / 51) = (300 + 78) / 51 = 9",
