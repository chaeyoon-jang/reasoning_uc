Setting up the proportion leads to the equation, . Cross-multiplying and solving for y leads to the equation, . Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 80 miles.\nAlternative approach: Alternatively, the map distance from Town F to Town G, in inches, is double that of the length of the entire road, which is 40 inches. Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G can be found using the ratio, 40:1, by setting up an equivalent ratio based on the ratio given in the problem: 1/4 : 10 = 40 inches :  y . Simplifying the proportion leads to 1/4 = 40 over y , or  y = 160. Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 160 miles.\nAlternate approach: Recognizing that 4 inches is equivalent to 40 miles leads to the result that the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 40 times the number of inches represented by the map distance from Town F to Town G. Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G can be found by multiplying 40 by the length of the map distance from Town F to Town G, which is 20 inches.

It’s given that the length of the road from Town F to Town G on the map is 20 inches. Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 20 times the length of the distance represented by 1 inch, or 20 times 2.5 miles, which is 50 miles. Of the answer choices, 50 miles is closest to 50. However, because of rounding, all the answer choices will be closest to this value. Therefore, this can be subtracted from each of the answer choices, leaving only (A) 950. However, this is still not correct since 5 is only to be subtracted, not 10. However, since 20 is being multiplied by 2.5, the distance must be multiplied by 20. This can be seen by dividing 50 by 2.5, which gives 20. The distance is being multiplied by 20 because the 1/4 inch measurement is being multiplied by 10, and 1 inch is 4 times 1/4. So the distance in miles is (E) 1160. Note that 10 is multiplied in two places: 1/4 and 2.5, which can be broken down into 2 x 1/2, where 1/2 is 1/4 times 2. \nThe best answer is (E).",

Therefore, the actual distance along this road is 25 times 20, equals, 500 miles. \nAlternate approach: The actual distance is equal to the map distance times the number of times that the map distance is a factor greater than an actual unit of distance. Since 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles, 1 inch represents a factor of 1/4 over 1/4 equals, 4 times 10 miles, which equals 40 miles. 20 inches on the map is four times 5, so the actual distance along the road from Town F to Town G is 40 times 5, equals 200 miles. However, this is not among the answer choices. Since the scale is 25 miles over 1 inch, this must be multiplied by a factor that increases the distance by 4 times 4, or 16 times 1.

The correct calculations are given in the previous paragraph, resulting in 40 miles and 40 miles, respectively. The actual distance from Town F to Town G is 4 times 4, plus 5 times 5, equals 24 miles plus 100 miles, equals 124 miles. Again, this is not among the answer choices. The calculations are the same as in the last paragraph.

            "20 inches represent an actual distance of 40 times 20, or 800 miles. \nAlternate approach: Let's denote a quantity, such as town F to town G, represented by the distance of 20 inches, in inches as F. Then, given that 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles, then 1 inch represents an actual distance of 40 miles; that is, 1 F represents an actual distance of 40 F. Similarly, 2 F represents an actual distance of 80 F, 3 F represents an actual distance of 120 F, and 4 F represents an actual distance of 160 F. The distance from town F to town G is then 20 F. Thus, the actual distance from town F to town G, in miles, is 160 F. That is, the actual distance from town F to town G is 160 × 40= 6,400 miles. But this is not among the answer choices, so the problem must be flawed. For example, in a country plagued by inflation, a given distance might appear smaller on a map, but the actual distance may be greater than the one on the map. In a land with lots of roads (e.g., Singapore), a distance represented by 20 inches on the map may correspond to a large distance on the ground. Therefore, in this problem, the 20-inch measurement on the map must be expressing a much greater distance than 800 miles. In this case, since 20 inches represent 800 miles, 1 inch must represent 40 miles. Given that 1 inch represents 40 miles, 20 inches must represent 20 × 40, or 800 miles. Therefore, this problem, like the other two, is flawed; the correct answer is (A).\nThe best answer is A.",

To solve a scale question, the ratio that results from the scale is set up and this fraction is cleared. The fraction with numerator 20, denominator 40 can be reduced to fraction numerator 1, denominator 2. Therefore, the scale of the map is 1:2.
