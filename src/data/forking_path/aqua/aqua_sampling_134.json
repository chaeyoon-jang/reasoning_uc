Therefore, the equation 15 s can be written as 42 with 25 percent removed. Using 25 percent of a value equals 25 over, oh, times the value, it follows that 15 s equals 42 minus 25 percent of s , or 42 minus 0 point 2 5 s.

It’s also known that 100 percent of the total cost of the issues will be equal to the cost of one issue. Let x represent the cover price per issue. Therefore, you can write an equation representing the given information and the unknowns in the problem as follows: 25% of 100% of x equals $42. Convert the percents to decimal form to simplify the equation. This yields the equation: 0.25×100%=42. Note that the 100% can be written simply as 1 in this equation. Once this equation has been written in this form, multiply .25 and 1. This yields 0.25. So the equation is now 0.25x equals 42. Now, divide both sides of this equation by .25 to solve for x. This yields the value 42 point 0 over 25, equals x. The area with a percent sign has been simplified to a simple number; to subtract 42 from .25 it is necessary to have the same form on both sides of the equals sign.

Of the cover price for each issue, 25 percent, or twenty-five tenth would equal the difference between the amount charged for a subscription to the magazine for 15 issues and the cost of 15 individual issues at the cover price.

The best way to solve this problem is to say that if a discount of 25 percent saves you $42 from the cover price, what was the original cover price before the discount?  You are told that $42 is 25 percent of the cover price; so you can express this as follows: cover price - $42 = .75  ×  cover price, where .75 represents 100% - 25% = 75%. You can simplify this equation to get:  .75  ×  cover price = cover price - $42. You can subtract the  cover price on both sides of the equation to get:  .75  ×  cover price - cover price = $42. You can rewrite this expression on the left-hand side to get: cover price  ×  (.75 - 1) = $42, which you can rewrite as  -  cover price  = $42.

On the other hand, a discount is essentially taking something away from the original quantity, thereby reducing the amount to be collected by the merchant. An amount is deducted from the cover price of the issues, but only a total of 25 percent is removed from the total of the 15 individual prices. Therefore, 0.75 represents the portion that remains. Thus, if 75 percent represents the remaining portion after the discount, then 25 percent is the amount that is deducted to get to the subscription price. This deduction is called the discount, and so we know that 42 equals the total of 15 times the fraction of the fraction that represents the cover price per issue minus 0.25, or 15 times the fraction equals the entire 100% (cover price) minus 25% discount.

Thus, this is 25 percent of 15 p, which can be written as  $15 p=\\left(0.25\\right)\\left(15 p\\right).$ Solving this equation for  p, you get \\begin{align*}15 p&=\\left(0.25\\right)\\left(15 p\\right)\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 15 p&=3.75 p\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 15 p-3.75 p&=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 11.25 p&=0\\end{align*} The system seems to yield no reasonable result, but actually, there is no error in the algebra here; the calculations are correct! The error lies in the way that you set up the equation: You're trying to solve the problem by subtracting from the price of 15 issues 25 percent of the price of a single issue. The problem statement tells you that this represents a 25 percent discount, and so you should subtract from the price of 15 issues 100 minus 25, or 75, percent of the price of a single issue, not 25 percent. That means you should use the expression 0.75 instead of 0.25 in the second term of the equation and you should change your system to \\begin{align*}15 p&=\\left(0.75\\right)\\left(p\\right)\\\\ 15 p&=0.75 p\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 15 p-0.75 p&=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 14.25 p&=0\\end{align*} $14.25 p=0$ makes more sense, and solving this equation for  p  gives you a result: \\( \\begin{array}{l} 14.25 p=0 \\\\ \\frac{14.25 p}{14.25}=0\\end{array} \\) $p",

And, since the given saving is 25 percent of the cover price, the 25 percent reduction in price is 0.25 ⋅ C . It follows that the cover price, C , is reduced by $0.25 ⋅ 2.80 = $0.70. Since the cost of a single issue is reduced by $0.70 to produce the cost of 15 issues for $42.00, you can find the cover price of a single issue by subtracting the reduction from the cost of 15 issues. The cover price is therefore $42.00 -$0.70 = $41.30. But this is the cost of a 15-issue subscription. You must find the single issue price.

Since 25 percent of the cover price of an issue is given by $2.80, the cover price per issue is 4 times 25% of $2.80. This can be written as 4 (0.25)(2.80). Simplify to find the cover price. 4 times 0.25 equals 1, and 1 times 2.80 is 2.80. 4 times 0.25 equals 1, and 1 times 2.80 equals 2.80. The cover price is $2.80.\nAlternate approach: $2.80 represents the savings on 15 issues. $42.00 is the cost of 15 issues. The price without the savings for 15 issues is the original price of one issue plus the price of the issue after the saving plus the savings. Since $2.80 is the saving, this amounts to the price of one issue minus $2.80, which is the same as the original price of 15 issues. So, if 15 is the price without savings, then 15 + 2.80 is the price without savings. So, $42 is the original price of 15 issues. 42 ÷ 15 is 2.80, and the savings of $2.80 has been subtracted from the price of one issue. So, the price of one issue is $2.80 plus the savings of $2.80, which equals $5.60.

The cost of 15 issues after a 25 percent discount can be expressed as 15 x (1− 0.25) = 15 x 0.75 = 11.25 x . Multiplying 11.25 x by 15 gives the cost of the set of 15 issues, which equals 42. Therefore, x  = 42 ÷ 11.25 = 3.73. There are 12 months in a year, but the question asks for the annual cost for 15 issues of a magazine. The cover price per issue of this magazine is $3.73, and each is an approximate rate based on a 12-month period. (D) is correct.\nThe best answer is (D).",
            " the price of a single issue. Of the $42.00 of the savings of 25 percent, 42 is 25 percent of the cover price of all 15 issues. Therefore, multiply 0.25 by 15 to determine the price of a single issue, which is equal to 42. The equation is 0.25 times 15 equals 42, or 3.75 times x equals 42. Solving for  x , you get  x , equals, 42 divided by 3.75, or 11.20. Of these answers, only 11.20 can be made from the answer choices without using a calculator. Check whether it's possible to see that 11.20 times 15 gives $168, which is not the cover price per issue for 15 issues. So 11.20 must be eliminated. 42 over 42 is equal to 1.01. Therefore, 3.75 over x is equal to 1.01. Solving for  x  gives x  is equal to 42 divided by 3.75, or x  is equal to 11.20. This is not among the choices, but multiplying 11.20 by 3.75 gives 42. Therefore, 3.75 over  x  must be equal to 1.01. Since  x  equals 42 over 3.75,  x  equals 42 divided by 3.75, and 42 over 3.75, 3.75 divided by x  equals 42. In order to make the calculations easier, multiply 42 over 3.75 and 3.75 over 42 to get 1. Now multiply 3.75 over 42 and 42 over 3.75 to get 1. Likewise, dividing 42 over 3.75 and multiplying 42 over 3.75 gives 1. Multiplying 42 over 3.75 and 3.75 over 42 gives 1. Multiply each of the two numerators and each of the two denominators to find that (42 times 42) over (3.75 times 3.75) equals 1. 42 squared divided by 3.75 squared equals 1. 1.4285 equals 1.

            " the subscription for 15 issues is a discount of 25 percent off the cost, the total cost of the subscription represents 75 percent of the cost of all the individual issues. So, 75 percent of 15 x  is $42. Because there are 15 issues, multiply the cost of the single issue,  x, by 15 to get the expression for the total cost of the 15 issues. So, 15 x represents the cost of the 15 issues. Also, 75 percent of 15 x is the same as (75/100)(15 x )=3(15 x ), or 3(15 x ). Since this is also the cost of the subscription, 3(15 x )=42.

This information isn't really necessary for the basic calculation of the cost of a single issue, but it does tell you to think about how much the total price has been lowered by 25%. The 25 percent reduction can also be written as 0.25, and can be subtracted from 1.00 to express the remaining 75 percent as 0.75, the fraction of the total price that is covered by the number of issues you buy. Therefore, you can set up the equation 0.75( x ) = 42. This tells you that 75 percent of the single issue price equals $42.00.

We know that the cover price of the subscription and the original price of the subscription represent a 25 percent savings. Therefore, we can set up the equation (280) = (100)( x ), where  x  represents the cover price of the subscription. Now we can solve for  x  to find the price per issue: (280) = (100)( x ) 280 = 100 x   , so  x  = 2.80 Subtract 100 x  from both sides of the equation to solve for x . 280 - 100 x  = 2.80 - 100 x   , which simplifies to 180 = 100 x . Now, divide both sides of the equation by 100 to find the value of  x : 180 = 100 x   , which simplifies to 1.8 =  x . Therefore, the cover price per issue is $1.80, which is equivalent to 180 cents.

For example, if you know that the cost of a single issue is $4.73, the total cost for 15 issues is $71.05, and the magazine is representing a 25% savings, the cost before the discount would have been $71.05 ÷ (1 – 0.25) = $71.05 ÷ 0.75 = $94.80, which is not the cost for a 15-issue subscription.

Try $4.20, and the total cost would be $63.00, with a 25% discount of $15.75, which is too high. So, the correct answer is greater than $4.20. Let's try $4.50: the total cost would be $67.50, and a 25% discount would be $16.88, which is too high. If you try $4.40, the total cost would be $66.00, and a",

At that point, if a 25% saving is factored in, the cost of one magazine (assuming your question means the savings, rather than the price before the savings) will be the price of a single issue after the savings minus 25% of the price of a single issue before the savings. The cost of a single issue after the savings is 0.75(168), which is $126.

In this case, we need to calculate the 100% total discount, or the original price of 15 issues. The original price for 15 issues is the original price of a single issue, so the original price of a single issue can be found by taking 42 ÷ 15. 42 ÷ 15 = 2.80.

Divide both sides by 0.75 to get  x  = 42 ÷ 0.75 = 56.00. If the original cost is $56.00, a 25 percent discount will be (0.25) (56) = $14.00. The question asks for the cover price. Therefore, the cover price is 56 – 14 = $42.00. So the correct answer is (B).\nThe best answer is B.",

            " However, that is not one of the answer choices. Therefore, look at another aspect of the question. The magazine has been discounted by 25 percent. The original price of a 15-issue subscription before the discount is a 25 percent discount would be  x × (1 – 0.25). Rewrite as x × 0.75. This would be the price for a 15-issue subscription. Since the discounted price of the 15-issue subscription is $42, then 15 x  = 42. Divide both sides by 15 to get  x  = 42 ÷ 15 = 2.80. Since 2.80 = 15 x  × 0.75, substitute 2.80 for  x  and solve 15 × 0.75 = ? . So 15 × 0.75 = 21.75. Therefore, the original price of a 15-issue subscription is $21.75. Now, what was the price per issue of a single issue? Divide the cost of the subscription by the number of issues: $21.75 ÷ 15 = $1.45. Therefore, the price per issue is $1.45. Since $1.45 ≠ 2.80, try another method. Think in terms of percents: $42.00 is 75 percent of the original price. If 75 percent of the price is $42.00, then 100 percent of the price must be ( x  ÷ 0.75) × 100 = ( x  × 100 ÷ 75) . Now, 100 ÷ 75 can be written as 100/75, or 100 ÷ 75 =  $\\frac{100}{75}$ . Therefore,  $\\frac{100}{75} x= $\\frac{100}{75} x$ = $\\frac{100}{",

Since the price of a single issue is the price for a single issue multiplied by the number of issues (15), if the price of a single issue is $56.00 and the magazine costs $42.00 for 15 issues, the remaining cost is $56.00 × (15 – 15) = $56.00 × 0 = $0.00, so the combined magazine cost is $42.00, and you could have eliminated any answer that is more than $42.00.

The price of 15 issues is 15 x. The total cost of the 15 issues is 42.00. Therefore, 15 x  = 42.00. Divide both sides by 15 to get  x  = 42 ÷ 15 = 2.80. However, this is not among the answer choices. You must set the problem up differently to find the value of  x . The saving is 25 percent of the cost of 15 issues. This can be set up as 15 x  = 100% + 25% of 15 x  to show that the cost of 15 issues is 100% + 25% of the cost of one issue. Therefore, the equation is 15 x  = 100 x  + 25 x . Subtract 100 x  from both sides to get 15 x  - 100 x  = 25 x . Since 15 x  - 100 x  = -85 x ,  -85 x  = 25 x . Add 85 x  to both sides to get 0 = 110 x . Divide both sides by 11 to get 0 =  x . However, this does not make sense because  x  must be positive and also because 15 x  cannot equal 0. You have not yet solved the problem.

Let  y  be the price of the cover price. 25%  of  $y  = $2.80 Thus,  0.25 y  = 2.80 Divide both sides of the equation by 0.25 to solve for  y :  y  = 2.80 ÷ 0.25 = 11.20 The correct price of a single issue is $11.20.

However, you're asked what the 25 percent saving is compared to the price of a single issue, so if the cover price of a single issue is $3.00, the price of 15 issues would be $45.00, and $45.00 - $42.00 = $3.00; $3.00 is 6.7%, not 25%. To eliminate answer choices (E) and (D), calculate the actual percent saving in (A) and (B), and eliminate (B), leaving (A) as the correct answer.

            " Since the total cost is a savings of 25 percent of the total cover price, the original price is $42 ÷ (1 – 0.25), which is $56. Thus, you are given that the savings are 25 percent, or 0.25 of the original price, which allows you to set up the equation: $42 = 0.25($56) Since the price is a number and can be divided by 0.25 to find the original price, it is appropriate to divide by 0.25 instead of multiplying by 4/25. $42 ÷ (0.25) = $42 ÷ (4/25) $42 × (25/4) = 21.00 x, which is the cover price per issue. The cover price per issue is $21.00. (Therefore, (A) and (C) are incorrect.)
