The membership payment will be $2 x  3 = $6 (so $6 is added to the $12) and the total is $18 (cost $18−$12 = $6). Since $6 is greater than the monthly cost of the membership, we can stop looking. If you rent 3 DVDs, then buying a membership is a better deal than renting DVDs. The correct answer is (C).\nThe best answer is C.",

If you rent only one DVD, the cost of renting it with a membership is $2.00, which is the same as renting it at the store without membership. Thus, (A) is incorrect. Because the membership costs $7.00, you need to rent enough DVDs so that the cost of the membership plus the cost of the rentals is less than the cost of renting at the store. The membership does not matter in this case, so it's possible to rent just one. Thus, (B) is incorrect. Now, if you rent two DVDs, the cost of renting with the membership is $4.00, which is more than the cost of renting at the store, so (C) is incorrect. If you rent 3 DVDs, the cost of renting with the membership is $6.00, which is more than the cost of renting at the store, so (D) is incorrect. However, if you rent 4 DVDs, the cost of renting with the membership is $8.00. This is more than the cost of renting at the store ($4.00).

To get this all into one equation, you can substitute the number of DVDs rented from the first equation into this second equation: 2 + (3 x (total cost / 4)) = total cost.

By using the 2 DVD rental as a sort of threshold, the problem of this question asks what number of DVDs you would need to rent for it to be worth it to purchase the membership. Note that you must rent no fewer than 2 movies in order to pay the membership fee. In order to make it worth it to purchase the membership you should at least pay for 2 times the cost of the membership, which is $14.00. So, you must pay at least $14.00 to purchase a membership, which is also more than the cost of 7 DVDs. Since each movie costs $4.00, 7 DVDs cost $28.00. However, only 7 DVDs are needed in this case. If 2 movies cost $8.00 to rent and you add the membership fee, you will always pay more than $14.00 if you rent more than 2 movies.

This shows that if you rent more than 5 DVDs in the month, you should rent them with a membership. Of course, you would still need to also pay the $7.00 for the membership. Remember, you are paying extra money for the membership, so that the combined cost is even higher when comparing the membership to the normal pricing. Since each additional DVD is only $2.00 with the membership compared to $4.00 for a single movie rented without a membership, you need more than one additional DVD per month in order to make the membership a good deal. There would be no benefit in renting one more DVD with the membership. When you pay for the membership, the extra movie breaks even. (This may seem confusing.)

With three films per month, the cost is $7.00 + 3 × 2, which is less than 4 × 3, so again purchase is cheaper. With four films per month, you rent for $7.00 + 4 × 2, which is greater than 4 × 4, so rent is cheaper in this case. Renting five films or more will not be cheaper than buying a membership.

With a membership, you need to pay $2.00 per DVD plus your membership fees of $7.00 per month. You can break this down as follows: $2.00 + $7.00 It doesn't matter how many DVDs you rent, as the membership fee remains constant every month. The membership fee is always greater than the total rental cost without a membership when $7.00 + 1 = $8.00 > $4.00 To determine how many DVDs you would need to rent to make it worthwhile to use the membership, we can set up the following inequality, which we can then solve using the following steps. To begin with, let x be the number of DVDs you rent. We know that $7.00 + $2.00 x > $4.00 Next, we need to get all the terms on one side of the inequality, so we'll subtract $7.00 from both sides of the inequality to get  $7.00 + $2.00x > $4.00 - $7.00 We can now subtract $7.00 from both sides, resulting in the following inequality. $2.00x > -$3.00 To get $2.00 x > -$3.00, we add $3.00 to both sides of the inequality to obtain  $2.00 x > $3.00 Since the inequality sign remains the same and we know $2.00  0, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $2.00, which gives us x > $\\frac{3.00}{2.00}.

This means that the membership must cost $7.00 (the cost of the membership) or less when considering the savings. On the other hand, if it costs more than $4.00 to rent a DVD using your membership, then it will not be worth it to buy the membership, and you will not save any money. In this case, the membership cost must be greater than $7.00. So, the minimum number of DVDs that must be rented with a membership is when the total cost of the rental fee and the membership is at least equal to the cost of buying the DVD outright, so that you are no worse off either way. That is, the cost of the rental fee plus the membership is equal to the price of a single DVD. Since the cost of the rental fee is $2.00, we can set up an equation: 2 x plus 7 = 4.

WE Luis-HernandezThe Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of California's provision for the school board to directly contract for certain medical services and the financial loss from a class-action suit between the school district and the nurses. The central question is \"Did the contract comply with the Free Exercise Clause?\"The Court focused the central issue: Was California taking such action on grounds applicable only to Catholics, or was it generally applicable to all religion? The majority acknowledged that, by focusing on religions with the same beliefs and practices as the challenged law, the Court could have struck down the entire state-funded salad bar at the hospital, which undoubtedly violated the Free Exercise Clause.

            " DVDs without a membership, the total cost would be 4 x , so we can set up the following equation to find when this equals the cost of renting x DVDs with a membership, which is 2 x : $\\left(\\$ 2 x\\right)-2(\\$ 7)=\\$ 4 x$ To solve this equation, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1 and add 14 to both sides to get: $\\left(\\$ 2 x\\right)+\\$ 14=\\$ 4 x+14$ The left side simplifies to 2 x  + 14 and the right side simplifies to 4 x  + 14. By subtracting 4 x from both sides, we have 2 x  - 4 x  + 14 = 14, which simplifies to -2 x  + 14 = 14. Subtracting 14 from both sides yields -2 x  - 2 x  = 14 - 14. We can combine like terms on the left to get -4 x  = 0, and divide both sides by -4, which yields $x=0$ If we interpret the number of DVDs as x, the minimum number of DVDs that must be rented is 0. This is a bit absurd, and you'll be tempted to get a percentage per DVD, so let's recheck our calculation by dividing 7 by 2, which gives a ratio of 35 to 10 in favor of purchasing over renting. In 1 rent the ratio is 4:1, and 5 rents is 10:5 in favor of renting. So the point at which this shifts over to 5 is actually 3 and is not an integer. You can't rent a fraction of a DVD, and since the choice that results from a 3 DVD is in favor of renting, there are at least 4 DVDs that are necessary to make the membership pay. Answer: (D)",

If you rent 2 DVDs per month, the cost of renting with no membership is 2(4) $= $8, and the cost of renting with a membership is 2(2) $= $4. Therefore, no membership is cheaper than renting 2 DVDs. If you rent 3 DVDs per month, the cost of renting with no membership is 3(4) $= $12, and the cost of renting with a membership is 3(2) $= $6. Since 6 <12, membership is cheaper. If you rent 4 DVDs per month, the cost of renting with no membership is 4(4) $= $16, and the cost of renting with a membership is 4(2) $= $8. Since 8  16, it is cheaper to rent 4 DVDs without a membership. Thus, if you rent more than 4 DVDs per month, it is cheaper to rent with a membership, regardless of how many DVDs you rent.

To find the minimum number of movies to rent to make the membership fee per movie pay for itself, we solve the equation: 4 x - 2 x  7 = 0 2 x  7 = 2 x = 7.
