The length of the 6-inch space between pickets must be subtracted from each picket, so the total length of the pickets is 13 - 6 = 7 times the length of a single picket. Thus, the total length of the fence, in inches, is 7 times the length of one picket. Now, since each picket is 1/2 inch, the length of the fence in inches is 7 times 1/2. Therefore, the length of the fence in inches is 7*(1/2), or 7/2. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the length of the fence in feet is the length of the fence in inches divided by 12: (7/2) /12.

            " asks for the length of a picket fence. A straight picket fence is composed of pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide, and there is a 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Therefore, the length of the fence can be found by calculating how many pickets are in the fence, finding the length in inches, and then converting it to feet. It’s given that the width of each picket is 1/2 inch. Since each pair of pickets is separated by 6 inches, and there are x pickets in the fence, there are x-1 spaces between the pickets. It follows that the total length of the fence can be represented by the expression 1/2x+(6)(x-1). Adding the lengths of the spaces and the pickets results in x+3. Adding the fraction representing the length of the pickets to the total of the fractions of the lengths of the spaces yields x+3, which is equivalent to 3x+3. Dividing 3x+3 by 12 to convert to feet yields (3x+3)/12, which can be rewritten as x/4+1/4, or (x+1)/4. Finally, factoring the numerator of this fraction yields the equivalent fraction  (13x+12)/24.Choices A, C, and E are incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.\nThe best answer is D.",

Then subtracting the 6 inches between each picket (and fence) means 6 is added to get the length of fence, so the total length is 156x - 6.

Each ½ is equivalent to 1/2 inch. Thus, (1 + ½ + 1 + ½ + ... + 1 + ½) = x+ x × ½. Combining like terms, this expression is equivalent to 2x + x(½) or 2x + x/2. Multiplying 2x by 1/2 is the same as multiplying 2x by ½, and when we do this, the result is 2(x)(½), which is equivalent to x. So, 2x + x/2 is equivalent to 2x + x.

Finally, add the length of the pickets:  x × 1/2  = x/2 . Adding these lengths of the pickets to the length of the spaces between pickets yields  x/2 + 1.5. Then the expression  x/2 + 1.5  =  (x+3)/2  . But this expression is not among the answer choices, so it must have been a mistake. So think again. It seems there are 13 pickets and 6 spaces between the pickets. There are 13 pickets in total, so if each has a length of x inches, there must be 13x inches of pickets in total. Similarly, there are 6 spaces between the 13 pickets, so there must be 6 × 1/2  = 3 inches of spaces. The length of the picket fence is 13x + 3. To convert the 3 inches to feet, divide the inches by 12: 3/12 = 1/4 foot. So the length of the fence is 13x + 1/4  =  (13x+1) /4 . Since  (13x+1) /4 is among the answer choices, you know the answer is (D).",

The length of the entire fence in feet is 13 x^2 / 2. Choice B is the result of subtracting the 6 inches of space in the fence from 13 x feet. Because 1 inch equals 1/12 feet, 6 inches equals 6 x (1/12) feet, or 6 x 1 / 12 = 6 / 12 = 1 /2 foot. Now, if you subtract 1/2 foot from 13 x feet, you get: 13 x feet - 1/2 foot. 1/2 foot is the same as 6 / 12 feet, so choose (E) as the correct answer. Be careful not to cancel terms that result in a fraction. Choice (A) is the result of multiplying x by 13 and then dividing by 2 to account for 1/2-foot spaces. The correct answer is (E).",

To change this to feet, divide by 12, or 6.5 + 72 = 78.5 ÷ 12, which gives 6.52  3/4 feet, or 6 3/4 feet. This can be written as 13(1/2) + 12(6) = 13 x 1/2 + 12 x 6 = 13x/2 + 72 = 13x/2 + 72 = 13x + 72 / 2 = (13x + 72) / 2 = (13x + 72) / 2.

There are 13 such spaces (there are 12 pickets because the first space includes the last space at the right-hand end). Each of these spaces has a length of 6, so the length of the spaces is 13(6) = 78 inches. The width of the entire fence is 13x (each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 13 pickets). If we convert the width to inches to the left side, this is the same as 13x inches. The length of the entire fence is, therefore, 13x + 78 inches. Since the length of the entire fence is 2 feet per foot, then the answer is (13x + 78)/2 = (13x + 39)/1. Therefore, 13x + 39. The correct answer is (D).",

So, there are a total of 13 (for all the pickets) + 30 (for all the spaces) = 43 inches of length on the fence. The length in feet is this measurement divided by 12, or 43/12 inches, which equals (43 ÷ 12) inches = (43 × 1) / (12 × 1) = 13/12. This equals 1 and 1/12 = 1 1/12. You could also use blocks to solve the problem: The figure below shows what the fence would look like if each space between pickets were 6 inches wide. There would be 12 inches for each picket and 13 pickets for a total length of 13 × 12 = 156 inches. There are 12 inches in one foot, so the length of the fence is 156/12 = 13 feet. Now, since each picket is 1/2 inch wide, then the actual width of the fence is 13 × (1/2) = 13/2 = 6 1/2. It would be helpful to realize that the space is made up of 5 of the 1/2 inch widths, which is 5/2. The space would therefore be 6 1/2 - 5/2, which is 1 1/2. Because there are 13 1/2 inches of length, the length in feet is (13 1/2) ÷ 12, which equals 1 1/12, and of course, 13/12.

These can be represented as: x + 1 + 2 x We now add the lengths of the pickets and the spaces:   x + 1 + 2 x   = 3x + 1 inches The number of inches in one foot is 12, so we want to express our answer in terms of feet. So we will divide the number of inches by 12: (3 x  x + 1)/12  Because we are dividing the length of a whole object (the picket fence), we should keep this term the same, not re-write it in terms of just pickets and spaces: (3 x + 1 )/12. To remove the integer portion, we can rewrite 3 x  as 13 x - 2 x , because there are 13 x pickets. Therefore,  (3 x  + 1)/12  = (13 x  - 2 x  + 1)/12. This is the exact fractional representation of the picket fence in feet, so this is the correct answer.

The length of each picket is half an inch, and there are x pickets in the fence, so the total length of the pickets is ½ x. Similarly, there are x spaces between the pickets and each is six inches, so the total length of the spaces is 6x. This means the total length of the fence in inches is ½ x + 6x. The next step is to get this into a simpler form by factoring out ½ x on the left-hand side to obtain ½ x  + 6x = (½ x  + 6) x. So the length of the fence in inches is (½ x  + 6)x.

Let's start with the first part, the length of the fence contributed by the pickets. This can be written as  x (the number of pickets) times 1/2 (the length of each picket): x(1/2). To evaluate x(1/2), you multiply the number by the fraction, and this gives you x/2. The next thing to do is figure out the length of the fence contributed by the spaces between the pickets. We know that there are x spaces and each space is 6 inches long. This can be written as x(6). And, finally, we have to remember that the 6 inches we used to measure the length contributed by the spaces is an extra 6 inches that needs to be added on to the total, which we now know to be x/2. Since there is an extra 6 inches, we need to add 6 inches to our current total. If you write these pieces together, you get the complete equation: x/2 + 6 Now we need to turn the entire expression into a single fraction. You do this by finding the lowest common denominator of the pieces. Since the denominator in the fraction in the first piece of our equation is 2, and the second piece is added with no denominator (or the denominator of 1, which is the same as the number 1), the lowest common denominator of the two is 2. The first piece of the equation should be multiplied by 2: 2 times x/2, which is equal to x. The second piece of the equation is already written with a denominator of 1, so you only need to add the same 6 to this. The two pieces of the equation together, written with the lowest common denominator of 2, is:  x + 6 . Now that we have written everything in terms of the same denominator, we need to convert it to the final answer in feet.

Thus, (E) is correct. (A) is incorrect. Here you divided by 2; the question asked for the length in feet, and therefore division by 12 was needed, not division by 2. (B) and (C) are incorrect because they represent the number of pickets times 6 (inches), rather than adding space between them.

Because there are 12 inches in one foot, the answer is the length of the fence in inches divided by 12 to convert the inches into feet. Therefore, (x + 6( x  -1)) ÷ 12 = (x + 6 x - 6) ÷ 12 = 7 x - 6 ÷ 12 =  $\\frac{7 x-6}{12}$   Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is  $\\frac{7 x-6}{12}$ .

The number of spaces is one less than the number of pickets, or x minus one. There are (x minus one) spaces of 6 inches each. So the length of the fence in inches is 5x, plus 6 times (x minus one). 5x, plus 6x minus six can be written as 11x minus 6.

Note that the (n - 1) comes from subtracting 1 from n, not n -1 for the number of spaces. (If you added 1 to n, then there would be  n spaces, not n -1).

The number of spaces between pickets is  x since there is one space between each of the x pickets. The length of each space between pickets is 6 inches, so the total length of all of these spaces is 6 x  in. It follows that the total length of the fence is  x  plus 6x, or 7 x .

On the other hand, the choices (B) , (C) , and (E) add a 6  or subtract a 6 from the total length of the fence, which is clearly too small, so (B), (C), and (E) are incorrect. Of the remaining two choices, (A) gives a  result of 13 x 2, which is clearly too large, so this must be incorrect as well.

It might have been reasonably acceptable to ignore the presence of units and assume that the total length of the fence in inches equals 7 x . However, units are important; for example, (E) must be eliminated since (7 x  ) > (13 x  ). Therefore, it is important to determine the actual length of the fence. Based on the diagram, the sum of the length of a picket and the length of the space adjacent to the picket on either side of a picket is 1.5 inches.

            " and the lengths of the spaces. Each space has a length of 6 inches. It’s given that x pickets are on the fence. Therefore, there are 8 of the spaces on the fence because each space corresponds to two pickets. It follows that the total length of the fence is 8 times the length of a single space, which is equivalent to 8 times 6, plus the width of x pickets. Since the width of each picket is 1/2 inch, it follows that the width of x pickets is equal to x halves. This is equivalent to x/2. Adding 8 times 6, plus x/2, can be rewritten as 6 times 8 plus x/2, which is equivalent to 48 plus x/2. Converting 48 to a fraction with a denominator of 2 yields 96 over 2, which is equivalent to 48 plus x/2. Now, since 48 and x/2 both have a denominator of 2, the resulting fraction, 48 plus x over 2, is the equivalent mixed number 24 and x/2 feet. Since it’s given that 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the expression 24 and x/2 feet is equivalent to 288 inches plus x inches, which is equivalent to 288 plus x inches. Converting 288 inches to feet by dividing 288 by 12 yields 24, so 288 plus x is equivalent to 24 plus x feet. Now, since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the length of the fence can be represented by 24 plus x/12, which is equivalent to 24 plus x over 12, which is equivalent to (24x+12)/12, which can be rewritten as (24x+12)/12, and is therefore equivalent to (2)(12x+6)/12, which is equivalent to 12x+6. The expression 12x+6 can be rewritten as 12x+6 by factoring out a 2 and the expression 12x+6 is also equal to (12x+6), which is a way of writing it. In the expression (12x+6), 12x+6 can be rewritten as 12 times x plus 6, which is equivalent to the fraction 12x",

If the length of the fence is measured in inches, the length is 72.

The total length of the fence is the sum of these two lengths: 1/2x + 6(x - 1). In simplest form, this expression is 6x + 3x - 6, which can be written as 9x - 6.

Choice (C) incorrectly represents the length of the spaces between the pickets as 3x instead of 6x. Choice (A) incorrectly forgets to subtract 1 from the x values.

Since there are 5 spaces between the pickets, the total length of the spacings is 5(6) = 30 inches. The total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of the pickets and spacings, so the length of the fence is x + 30. This is 1 foot long, so the length of the fence is 12 inches. Therefore, 12 inches = x + 30, and x = 12 - 30, so x = -18 inches. This is nonsensical because we can't have negative widths. Another way to set up the equation is to calculate the number of pickets and spacings in terms of x. There are 5x pickets, so 5 spacings are added between these pickets. 5 spacings is equivalent to 30 inches, and 5(x + 1) is equivalent to (5x + 5), so the length of the fence is 13x + 5 = (13x + 5) /24 feet.

In the problem it is given that the length of a space is in inches, so the length of a picket should also be given in inches, not feet. A picket is ½ inch long. The length of the fence is 13(pickets) times (½ inch) + 6 (spaces) times (6 inches). Therefore, (13)(½)+6(6) = 6.5+36= 42.5 inches. Since the question asks for the length in feet, 42.5 inches ÷ 12 inches per foot = 3.542857 feet. 13/2 = 6.5, and 6(6) = 36 so 13/2+6(6)=6.5+36=42.5 inches. If you multiply 42.5 inches by 12, you get 507 inches. 507 inches ÷ 12= 42.5 feet. You can simplify 13x/2 to x 6.5 and 6(6) to 36 so x 6.5 + 36= 42.5 inches. If you multiply 42.5 by 12, you get 507. You can simplify 6(6) to 36 so 6(6)=36. Therefore 13x/2 - 6(6)= 42.5. Since you know that 42.5 = 42.5 inches, you can convert to feet. 42.5 = 507/12= 42.5 feet. You can simplify 6(6) to 36 so 6(6) = 36. Therefore 13x/24 + 1 = 169/24 + 1. Converting 1 to 12/24, you get 169/24 + 12/24 = 181/24.

The length of the fence is (x + 36)/2, which is equivalent to (x + 36)/2 - 18. Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is (x + 36)/2 - 18 = (13x + 12)/2 feet.

Since the number of terms is infinite, it's not an infinite geometric series but rather a sequence of terms 6, 12, 18, and so on. So, we can represent the length of the fence as:  6 + 12 + 18 +... + 6(n + 1) for some value of n. Since each term is 6, we can write the length of the fence as 6n + 6 + 6 + ... + 6, or 6n + 6(n + 1). Factoring out 6, we have 6(n + 1) + 6n. Factoring the final 6, we have 6(n + 1 + n) which can be simplified to 6(2n + 1). Now, the problem states that the pickets are 1/2 inch wide, so the total width of the fence is (n + 1) times the width of each picket, or n + 1. But the length of each picket is 1/2 inch, so the length of the fence, in inches, is 6(n + 1) * 1/2. Since we want to find the length of the fence in feet, we multiply by 12, or the number of inches per foot, so we get 12 * 6(n + 1) * 1/2. Factoring out 6, we have 6 * 12 * (n + 1) * 1/2 which simplifies to 6(12(n + 1) / 2) which is 6(6(n + 1)). This simplifies to 36(n + 1).  n is the number of pickets along the side of the fence, and so we know that the answer must include x, which represents the number of pickets on one side of the fence.

It follows that the length of each picket is 1/2 x inch and the length of each space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches. Because the length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of the pickets and the lengths of the spaces, the equation representing the length of the fence, in inches, can be expressed as x (1/2) + 5 (6). Converting x inches to feet and 6 inches to feet gives x/12 + 30 feet. This fraction can be rewritten by multiplying the top and the bottom by 2, which gives (2 x/12) + 60 feet. Further simplification yields x/6 + 60 feet. Multiplying the fractions in this expression by 12/12 yields (12 x/72) + 720 feet, which simplifies to 2x/6 + 720 feet.

Because the width of the pickets and spaces is 1/2 inch, you can divide the length of the fence, in inches, by 12 to determine how many feet make up the fence: the number of feet of picket length (x/2)(13) = 13x/2. Then the number of feet between the pickets, in inches, is (6x) inches. Because this distance must be divided by 12, the number of feet is (6x)/12 = (x/2). Finally, add 13x/2 and x/2 to determine the length of the fence: (13x/2) + (x/2) = 13x/2 + x/2 = 14x/2 = 7x. However, you were given answer choice (A), 13x/2, as the choice.

            " inches is  x (pickets) +  6 (spaces). To convert this to feet, divide by 12. The number of inches in one foot is 12, so the length of the fence is  ( x + 6 ) ÷ 12, which can be written as  x ÷ 12 + 6 ÷ 12, or  x ÷ 12 + ½ =  x ÷ 12 + ½ . You can subtract ½ from the fractions by combining them with a common denominator of 12. When you do this you get  x ÷ 12 + 6 ÷ 12 - 6 ÷ 12, or ( x ÷ 12) + (6 ÷ 12) - (6 ÷ 12). Eliminate (A) and (D). Adding the fractions is similar to the last step above. When you add  x ÷ 12 + 6 ÷ 12 you can add the numerators and leave the denominator the same:  x ÷ 12 + 6 ÷ 12 = ( x + 6 ) ÷ 12.  x ÷ 12 + ½ can be written as ( x + 6 ) ÷ 12 + ½. The ( x + 6 ) ÷ 12 is the same as the expression in (B), so ( x + 6 ) ÷ 12 + ½ = (13 x ÷ 24). Eliminate (C). Add the remaining answers and (13 x ÷ 24) to eliminate (E). Choices (A), (D), and (E) all get smaller values, so they eliminate (D) (13 x + 1) ÷ 24 = 13 x ÷ 24 + 1 ÷ 24. You can think of 1 ÷ 24 as 1 / 24. There are 24 twelves in 24, so 1 is the same as 12/24. Therefore, (13 x + 1) ÷ 24 is the same as (13 x + 12) ÷ 24. Since you are adding 12 and 12 you can add the numerators: (13 x + 12)",

We need to find an equivalent expression for the number of pickets and the number of spaces in terms of x. Each picket adds 1 foot to the length, and each space adds 0.5 feet; since the first picket adds the full length of one picket and there are n pickets, the length of the pickets is x, times n; each of the spaces is between two pickets, so there are n - 1 spaces, each with a length of 0.5 feet, for a total of 0.5, times n - 1. This means the total length is equal to x, times the number of pickets, plus 0.5, times the number of spaces. But the total length of the fence is also equal to 13. The above expression for the length of the fence is  x n + 0.5 n - 0.5. The length of the fence is also equal to 13, since the total length is always 13. So it is possible to equate these two expressions: x n + 0.5 n - 0.5 = 13 Multiply both sides of the equation by 24 in order to clear the fractions: 24, times x n + 12, times 0.5 n - 12 = 312 x n + 12 n - 288 = 312 Multiplying 24 by the first term, 0.5 is the same as multiplying 24 by 2 and dividing by 4, which gives us 48 x n + 12 n - 288 = 312 Combining like terms and adding 288 to both sides, 48 x n + 12 n = 600 Since there are 12 pickets and 12 - 1 = 11 spaces, 48 is the same as 12 x 4 and 12 is the same as x 1.

There are 12 spaces between the pickets, and each space is 6 inches long. Thus, the length of the spaces is 12x inches. To get the total length of the fence in inches, add the lengths of the pickets and spaces. The length of the fence is 12x + 13x = 25x inches. Divide this quantity by 12 to find the total length of the fence in feet: you have 25x/12 ft.\nAlternate approach: in choice (C), assume that the pickets are 0.5 inches wide, which makes the length of each space 1 inch wide. There are 13 pickets, so the length of the pickets is 13x. There are 12 spaces, so the length of the spaces is 12 inches. But the width of the pickets also counts twice, once for each picket: so the length of the spaces is also 13. Adding up the length of the pickets and the length of the spaces gives a total length of 13x + 13 = 26x. Divide by 12: 13x/12.

The spaces between pickets can be added to the length of the pickets by finding the sum of an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 6 and a common difference of 6. The length of each term can be expressed by a general term in an arithmetic sequence with first term a = 6 and common difference d = 6 as 6 + (n - 1)6 = 6 + 6n - 6 = 6n. By summing the lengths of n terms in this sequence, an expression for the total length of the spaces between the pickets is (6 + 6n) + (6 + 6n) + . . . + (6 + 6n) = 6(n + n + . . . + n) = 6n(n + n + . . . + n). Since there are 13x terms in the sequence, n must equal 13x. Substituting 13x for n, the sum of the lengths of the spaces between the pickets is 6(13x) = 78x.

The least common multiple of 1/12 and 1/12 is 12/12. Then the expression becomes (12x/12)+(6/12), or (12x+6)/12. Now simplify by reducing the fraction: 12x/12 is x, and 6/12 is 1/2. So, the expression simplites to x + 1/2 or 2x + 1/2. Since you want the answer in feet, divide by 12 (or multiply by 1/12), which is equivalent to subtracting 1/12: 2x+1/2-(1/12). To subtract, find the common denominator. The least common multiple of 1/2 and 1/12 is 12/12. Since you want the answer in feet, divide by 12: 12(2x+1/2)-(1/12).  12x+6-1/12 is the same as 12x+6-1/12. You can't add or subtract fractions unless they have the same denominator, so change the 12x + 6 to 12x(12/12)+6(12/12)  which is (144x+72)/12. To add the fractions, you must have the same denominator. The common denominator is 12/12. The expression is now (144x+72/12)+(1/12). Adding, you get (144x+71/12). Now simplify by reducing the fraction: 71/12 simplifies to 71/12. So the expression simplifies to 144x/12+71/12 which is 144x/12 +71/12. When you add these fractions together, you get 215/12.

This is because a space starts after the first picket, but before the second one. So the length of the spaces is (x - 1) * 6. Set up the equation to show this, and solve for the total length of the fence: 13x/2 + (x - 1) * 6 = total length length 13x/2 + 6x - 6 = 13x/2 + 6x - 6 Total length = 9x/2 - 6x + 13x - 6 Since 9x - 6x is 3x and 13x - 6x is 7x, this is the same as 3x + 7x - 6 Which equals 10x - 6. So the total length of the fence is 13x/2 + 10x/2 - 6, or (13x + 10x) / 2 - 6. This equals (23x)/2 - 6, or 23x/2 - 6. But you want your answer in feet, so you need to convert this to feet. The width of the picket and the space in the answer choice should be measured in feet. Since the width of the picket is 1/2 inch, the width of the picket is 1/12 feet. Since 12 inches make 1 foot, the width of the picket is 1/12 feet. Therefore, the width of the space between the pickets is 6/12 feet, or 1/2 foot. So, your answer should include these conversions in the denominators of the terms. Convert the fraction 13x/2 to have a denominator of 12, and rewrite the answer choice with a denominator of 24 in terms of feet. 13x/2 * 12/12 = 156/12x 156/12x + 12/12 * 10x/2",

In general, the length of the pickets is given by the formula:  number of pickets × width of each picket to convert inches to feet, multiply by 12, since the question asks for the length in feet, not inches. The length of the fence, in inches, is given by: length of pickets + 6 × (number of pickets - 1). Substitute the number of pickets and the width of the pickets to get: 13x + 6 × (13x - 1) = 13x + 78x - 6 = 91x - 6 To convert the length of the fence to feet, multiply by 12 and subtract 6 × 12 to get: (91x - 6) × 12 = 1092x - 72 Thus, (C) is the correct answer.\nThe best answer is C.",

The total length of the fence in inches is x + x + 3 x. The total length of the fence in feet is the total length of the fence in inches divided by 12. To make the units work, multiply the expression by 12. You could also take the f this way: The length of the fence is 13x inches and there are 12 inches in a foot. $\\frac{13 x}{12}$ represents the length of the fence in feet. You can eliminate (A), (B), (D), and (E) because they do not represent the length of the fence in feet, or you can multiply (C) by 12 to see that it represents the length of the fence in feet: The length of the fence is 13 x inches, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the fence in feet is 13x/12 x 12 = 13x.

When 1 foot is subtracted, the answer is 13x over 12 minus 1 equals 13x over 12 minus 12 over 12, or 13x over 12 minus 12 over 12. This is choice B. In choice A, the 6 inches of space between the pickets are 6 over 12, or one half, inches. In choice C, the length of the pickets, the spaces between the pickets, and the whole fence all share a common denominator. But, 6 inches of space between the pickets means there are 6 spaces, and since there are 13 pickets, the denominator of the length of the fence in feet should have 13 rather than 12. Choice D is therefore incorrect. Choice E, minus 12 over 12, is equivalent to subtracting 1 from the fraction representing the fraction of the fence in feet. If a fraction is subtracted from another fraction, in order to subtract the two, you can subtract the fractions from the least common denominator.

This can be expressed by the equation: \\( \\begin{aligned} 13 x+\\left(12\\left(6\\right)\\right) & =13 x \\\\ 72 & =13 x-13 x \\\\ 72 & =0\\end{aligned} \\) Note that in the above equation, both sides are the same, so the equation is a statement and the variable, x, can be subtracted from both sides. To make the units consistent with the question, the equation should be rewritten as follows: \\( \\begin{aligned} 72 & =\\frac{13 x}{12} \\times \\frac{12}{12} \\\\ \\frac{72}{12} & =\\frac{13 x}{12} \\\\ 6 & =\\frac{13 x}{12} \\\\ \\frac{6}{1} & =\\frac{13 x}{12}\\end{aligned} \\) Therefore, if the width of the pickets is x and the length of the spaces between the pickets is 6, then the length of the fence in inches is \\( \\frac{13 x}{12} \\) since the length is 6 inches when the width is 1 inch. To change the length from inches to feet, multiply by 12 (1 foot = 12 inches), so the length of the fence is \\( \\frac{13 x}{12} \\times \\frac{12}{12}=\\frac{13 x}{12} \\) feet.

The number of pickets on the fence is 13x, so the length of the pickets in feet is (1/24)(13x) = (13x)/24. There are six spaces between the pickets, each of length 6 inches or 6 ÷ 12 = 0.5 feet. The total length of the spaces between the pickets is 6(0.5) = 3 feet. Adding the length of the pickets and the spaces together, the length of the fence is (13x)/24 + 3 feet. However, in terms of a choice given in the answer choices, there are no such answer choices as choice (B). So we need to re-evaluate our answers. Think of the problem another way: if the length of each space between the pickets is 6 inches, then the total length of the spaces between the pickets in feet is 6 inches * 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = 6 feet. Therefore, the total length of the fence is equal to 13x feet (for the length of the pickets) plus 6 feet (for the length of the spaces) and we have 13x + 6. The question asks for the length of the fence in feet and choice (B) is the only choice we have, and choice (B) = 13x + 6. Therefore, the answer is choice (B).",

Multiply each of the quantities by the length in inches, and then divide by 12 to convert to feet, to get 13x/12 feet.

Total length of the fence = 13x + 78 inches Convert 13x + 78 inches to feet by dividing by 12. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there will be 12(13x) + 78 feet in total length. Simplify the left-hand side of this equation. 156x + 78 = 156x + 78 feet The left-hand side of the equation in the expression on the left-hand side, 156x + 78, can also be written as 156x + 78, or 156x + 78/1 (or 156x + 78), so the expression in the numerator can be rewritten as the 78+156x over 1. Next, notice that there is a common factor of 6 in the numerator and denominator of the fraction 78/1. Dividing the numerator and the denominator by 6, the expression on the left-hand side can be simplified to (78 + 156x)/6, or 13x+13, over 1, which can also be written as 13(x +1), over 6. Now that you have simplified the left-hand side, evaluate the right-hand side of the expression on the right-hand side. The expression on the right-hand side is 13x+78 /24, or (13x + 78) / 24. The numerator of the fraction is 13x + 78. The numerator and denominator of this fraction both have a common factor of 13, so you can divide the numerator and the denominator by 13. (13x+78)/(13 * 2), which can also be written as (x+6) over 2, so the expression on the right-hand side can be simplified to (x+6)/2.

To get the length in inches of a space, multiply the total length of the spaces by 1. Multiply 12 by 6 to get the total length of the spaces. The total length of the spaces is 6 × 12 = 72 inches. The length of each space is 72/12, or 6. Each picket and each space of the fence is 1/24 of the total length of the fence. The total length of the fence is 13x inches. The length of the pickets, plus the length of the spaces between them, equals the length of the fence. Let L represent the length of the fence in inches. Choose one picket, and add the length of its space to find the length of that picket. The length of the picket plus the length of its space is 1/24. If the total length of the fence is L, multiply 1/24 of L by 13 to find the length of the picket, and add the length of its space, which is 6, and get 13L/24 + 6. Therefore, 13L/24 + 6 = L.  Therefore, 13L/24 + 6 = L. The equation can be rewritten by subtracting L from both sides. This gives you the equation 6 = (1/24)L. To solve the equation 6 = (1/24)L, multiply both sides of the equation by 24 to solve for L. To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 24 to get 6 × 24 = L. Multiply 6 by 24 to get 144. 144 = L. Therefore, L is 144. The equation shows that 144 inches equals the length of the fence in inches. To find the answer choice that represents the length of the fence in feet, divide 144 by 12. You can also eliminate answer choice (B) since you know that there",

Since the length of the fence is in feet, it should be divided by 12. The expression 7x + 78 inches can be converted to feet as follows: (7x + 78) in. ÷ 12 ft./in. = (7x + 78) ÷ 12 ft. The expression 7x + 78 ÷ 12 ft. can be rewritten as [(7x + 78) ÷ 12] ft. Now, this expression is very close to what is in (C), which is (13x + 1) ÷ 24. Think about what you are looking for. In (C), the number 24 is associated with 1/2 inch and 1/3 inch. We know that the entire picket fence is equal to x pickets, and each picket is 1/2 inch in length. Since there are 6 spaces of 1/3 inch, it means that 6 equal spaces amount to one inch. In other words, one inch has been obtained by dividing 6 pickets of 1/2 inch, hence 6  6 pickets of 1/3  equals one full inch. Thus, (1) 3 pickets of 1/2 inch  equals one full inch. Since the entire picket fence is equal to x pickets and it represents the number of 1/2 inch, we can say the length of the fence equals the number of pickets times 1/2 inch. The length of the entire picket fence is equal to the number of pickets times 1/2. So, the length of the entire picket fence can be written as (x)(1/2) =  x/",

Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields the following: 13x - 13x = 13 - x  13 - x = x 13 - 2x = 13 - 2x - 2x is the length of the spaces between the pickets in terms of x. Since each space is 6 inches, there are 2x  spaces between the pickets. The space between the first and last picket will be the same as the spaces between the other pickets because the fence is made up of uniform intervals of space. 6(13 - x) can also be written as 6x - 6x. Since the x is subtracted by the width of the picket, the 6 spaces should equal 6. The width of the pickets is half that of a typical fence post (so that the fence only consists of 12 pickets, one on either side of each space). The length of the space between two adjacent pickets is 6(12 - x) inches. Since the spaces are the same all along the fence, it follows that 6(12 - x) = 6 inches. Solving the above equation for x gives the following: 6(12 - x) = 6, x = 12 - 1 x = 11. Thus, if the length of the space between the pickets is 6 inches, there are 11 pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide, in the fence. Substituting 11 for x in the following expression yields the length of the fence: x/2 + 6(11 - x) = 11/2 + 6(11 - x) = 11/2 + 66 - 6x  Simplifying the expression on the right-hand side yields the following:",

The length of the fence in feet is (7x + 78)/12. However, it would be better to convert to feet by dividing each of the components of the addition into inches and then dividing by 12. That is, find (13x)/12 + (6*12)/12. This gives you (13x)/12 + 72/12, or (13x + 72)/12, or (13x + 6)/1. Therefore, (13x + 6)/12 represents the length of the fence in feet.Alternate approach: You might find that 13(1/2) + 6 represents the length of the fence in inches. Then, you might simplify 13(1/2) to (13/2), and you might find that (13/2) + 6 is (13 + 12)/2. That simplifies to 25/2, which is the same as (25/2) * (1/1) = 25/2. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, you may find that 25/2 is the same as (25*12)/2*12, which is (25*12)/24. Finally, you may see that 25*12 is 300, so 13x + 6 is equal to (13x + 6)/24.Choice A is incorrect. 13x/2 - 6 doesn't represent the length of the fence in feet.

Note that the remaining answer choices neglect the fact that the spaces between the pickets are the same as any other  space within the  fence. Alternatively, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: If a _{1} is the length of the first picket, a _{2} is the length of the second picket, ..., a _{12} is the length of the twelfth picket,  d is the difference between each picket's length, and n is the number of pickets, then  s = n(a1 + an)/2.

Alternately, the total length of the picket fence is the number of pickets times the length of each picket, plus the total length of the spaces between the pickets. Since the length of each picket is 1/2 inch and there are x pickets, the total length of the pickets is x times the length of the picket, which is x(1/2). Likewise, the total length of the spaces is 6 inches between each of the x - 1 gaps, so the total length of the spaces is 6(x - 1). Thus, the length of the fence is the total length of the pickets plus the total length of the spaces: (x)(1/2) + 6(x - 1). (x)(1/2) + 6(x - 1) = (x/2) + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6, or (13x - 12)/2 in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the length of the fence in feet is (13x - 12)/2 ÷ 12 = (13x - 12)/24. Another way to take 12 ÷ 2 is to multiply by the reciprocal of 2, which is 1/2.

Adding these two simplified expressions together, the length of the fence in feet is 5 + (13x + 12)/12, which equals (60 + 13x + 12)/12, which equals (72 + 13x)/12, which equals (72 + 13x)/12.

Thus, the length of the fence is (13x + 72)/12, which is equivalent to (13x + 72)/12. 6 can be written as 72/12. When you divide a number by 12, it is equivalent to adding 12 divided by 12 a certain number of times that the number equals.

            ", (B) is correct. Note that the answer to this question can also be determined by simply setting up an equation with the information given. If there are 6 spaces and the length of each space is 1/2, the length of the 6 spaces is (6)(1/2). Adding the length of the 13 pickets to the length of the 6 spaces gives 13 + (6)(1/2). Factoring 6 from the expression (6)(1/2) gives (6)(1/2) = 3. So the equation to determine the length of the fence is 13 + 3 = 16, or 13 + 3 equals 16. Simplifying this equation, 16/12 = 4/3, which can be converted to 13x + 3 = 4/3x by multiplying both sides by 3. 3, times 13, equals 39 and 3, times 3, equals 9. Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation 39 + 9 = 4/3x - 3x gives 30 = 4/3x - 3x. Adding 3x to both sides of the equation gives 30 + 3x = 4/3x. Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation 30 + 3x = 4/3x gives 3x = 4/3x - 30. Multiplying both sides of the equation 3x = 4/3x - 30 by 3 gives 9x = 4x - 90.
