(Only choice (C) allows for the two number difference to be greater than 1.Indeed, it does meet the criteria for the range of answer choices.)\n Now let's think about (C).

Indeed, you can see that 0 < x < 996 if and only if (496 > x > 3) where x is the recorded value.

Another method is to find the greatest two-digit number n such that n ≤ 12, and this value would be 12. Next, we need to determine the largest two-digit even value of n such that n <1023.65 < n +100. Clearly, n =1010. Having found n, we can now calculate the recorded property worth. Hence the recorded property worth = 10×100 + 18 = 918, and the actual worth= 10×100+23.65 = 1023.65 Therefore, the difference between the recorded and actual property worth is 1023.65–918=105.65 → 100 The answer is (B).",

Also, 1022 is divisible by 100, because 1022 divided by 100 = 10.22 (not a whole number).\n The difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth is:1023 - 1022 = 1.This is not among the answer choices.\n The greatest positive even integer less than or equal to 1022 is 1020. Since 1022 divided by 100 is 10.22 (not a whole number), the recorded value of property worth must be 1020. Again, 1020 - 1000 = 20 and 1020 is divisible by 100.\n The difference between actual property worth and recorded property worth is: 1022 - 1020 = 2 This is not among the answer choices.\n The greatest positive even integer less than or equal to 1020 is 1018. Since 1018 is not divisible by 100, the recorded property worth can only be 1018.\n The difference between actual property worth and recorded property worth is: 1018 - 1000 = 18. Also, 1018 is not divisible by 100. The next lower possible even integer worth is 1016, which is divisible by 100, since 1016 divided by 100 = 10.16 (not a whole number). The difference between actual property worth and recorded property worth is: 1018 - 1016 = 2. The difference between actual property worth and recorded property worth is 2.\n The correct answer is (D).",

For a number to be divisible by 100, its last two digits have to be either 00 or 00, or 00. For example, 1000 is a number divisible by 100, and 1020 is also divisible by 100. To find the actual difference, just subtract the smaller recorded value, 1000, from the actual value, 1023.60. You can eliminate the dollar sign for simplicity. You get 1023.60 - 1000 = 23.60. The question contains another statement that in the answer choice of (A), the difference is 23.65. The first number in the given problem does not contain a cents value, but it can be represented by a number in cents. Since 1000 cents = 10.00 dollars, it can be converted to decimal by simply dividing by 100, giving you a dollar value of 10.00 and, therefore, 1023.65 = 1000 + 23.65. So now that the value of the recorded value is now represented by 23.65 cents. Now 1023 - 1000 = 23. Since 23 cents is represented by 23.65 in the given answer choice, that shows that the recorded value of the property is actually lower than the actual value. So now you can go ahead and subtract 1023 - 1000 = 23. Multiply that by 0.65 (the additional 65 cents/100) to get the difference between the actual and recorded values: 23 x 0.65 = 15.05 The choice to eliminate is now (A). You can eliminate (C) since 35.62 is 1000 + 1000 x 3.62. Choice (D) is 1023 - 1000 = 23 and multiply by 0.65, which is also equal to 15.05. You can eliminate (D) since 2.65 < 15.05.

The recorded value of the property is 1020. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 1023.65 - 1020 = 3.65, which is not an option.

If we decrease the property worth of 2 dollars from the recorded property worth, we still have the recorded property worth divisible by 100, so the difference between the recorded property worth and the real property worth would be as follows: 1023.65 - 1200 = -76.35 (B) is not the correct answer. The recorded property worth can be made smaller than the actual property worth as long as we make it divisible by 100, by changing the last two digits. Let's try 700 - that's an integer. Changing the first two digits to 020 still keeps the value even, but now we can write 700 - 1023.65 = -323.65. If we change the last two digits again to 72, we can write 1023.65 - 1020 = 3.65. Note that we cannot keep the digit 0 in the leftmost place because if we do we would obtain another integer value. If we change the last two digits to 72, we have 1023.65 - 1172 = -149.35. This decrease in recorded property value is still too big; therefore, the recorded property value must be 720. Also, change the leftmost digits to 11 and we have 1023.65 - 1172 = -149.35. Because we have gone too far, we should not change the leftmost digits further and now we need to move to the next possibility, which is 162 or 200. We get the following outcomes if we choose 1023.65 - 1620 = -597.65 and we get that the difference decreases; if we choose 1023.65 - 2020 = -996.35, then the difference increases.

However, we know that the actual value is less than 1000, so we can disregard the 1112. The greatest positive integer less than or equal to 1023.65 is 1000.

However, if the recorded value is 900 or any positive integer greater than 900, the actual value would be either 900 or 902, but the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to 900 is 900.

So the recorded value can be only one of the even integers {2, 4, 6,8,... 1000}.  Since 1023 is odd, the recorded value must be less than 1023. However, there are two such even integers, which are 1022 and 1020. Hence the recorded value can be either 1022 or 1020. Now we know that the recorded value must be a factor of 1023.65 x 10=-0.15. In other words, the recorded value is either -15.65 x 10 or -12.15 x 10 and hence, when multiplying by 10 (to ensure that we get an integer in the tens place in the recorded value) we get -162-12.

But only 1000 is closest to 1023.5. If you say 1020 you will get another 2.5 . When 10.2 = .2 is added 12 .2 will be .6 then .6 is .6 / 2 . 0.3= $0.3 So the difference is 1023 - 1020 = 3. That would give you 1022.2 as well to be a round number.

The closest even value divisible by 100 above 1020 would be $1020. So, difference = $1023.65 – $1020 = $3.65. Since $3.65 is not an option, let us now try another value.

The recorded value must also be divisible by 100, so the last two digits of the recorded property value must be 00. So, the recorded value of the property has the form 2× 1000 + x, where x is an even number that is less than or equal to 20. The recorded value can be written as an integer value of the form 1020, 1000, 980, etc. As you can see, x can be 20, 18, 16, etc., to make 1000, 980, 960, etc. The difference between the actual value of the property and the recorded value is given by 1023.65 - (the smallest value of the recorded property), which is 1023.65 - 1020.

The difference between the actual value and the recorded value of the property is $1023.65 - $1022 = $1.65 But it is not given among the choices. In that case, there must be an error in your calculation. Check to make sure that you interpreted the wording correctly. That there are two even integers both between 1022 and 1023.65 which are divisible by 100 is correct. So there are two possible recorded values of the property (namely, $1000 and $1200). Thus $1.65 is the difference between the first recorded value and the actual property value. $1.65 is not given in the choices but it is actually a trick choice (so find a different answer). $1.65 = $1000 - ($1022). In order to find $1000 - $1022, we need to subtract $1022 from $1000, therefore the recorded value of the property in that case is greater than the actual value. $1022 is the greatest positive even integer between 1022 and 1200. This is the wrong choice. Another choice, $1020, has also has $1000 as its greatest positive even integer between 1020 and 1022. This is also the wrong choice since the actual value of the property is larger. Thus $1000 is the greatest recorded value of the property, but it is not among the choices. Let's also think in a different way. Since the actual value is $1023.65 and it is an odd value, the greatest positive even integer less than $1023.65 is $1022. Thus the recorded value of the property must be $1020, since it is also divisible by 100. The difference between the recorded and actual value is then $1020 - $1023.65 = -3.65.

The recorded value is 102189, and the actual value is 102190. The difference between the recorded and actual value is 102190−102189=1, which is the value of choice (D). That is the correct answer.",
            "1022. Therefore, the difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 1023.65 – 1022 = 1.65. Since none of the answer choices match this, the difference between the actual value and the rounded value may not be 1.65. This implies that the property is not divisible by 100. To obtain the recorded value of the property in thousands, we may divide 1023.65 by 100 and take the floor function. The floor function of 1023.65 is 1023. So, the recorded value of the property in thousands is 1023. Hence, the recorded value in the form of actual value ÷ 1000 is 1.023, which corresponds to 1 thousand. It is now possible to get the recorded value in thousands as 1022. We can now use the given information and the preceding results to calculate the actual difference between the recorded and actual property worth. The actual difference in value is 1022 – 1023 = –1 thousand. Subtracting the difference from the actual value, the actual difference in value in dollars is –1 × 1023.65 = –1,023.65. Since the difference between the actual and recorded values is 1023.65 – 1022 = 1.65 and is negative, 1022 – 1023 = –1 thousand. We can similarly subtract the difference in value in thousands from the actual value in thousands. In this case, subtracting –1 thousand from 1 thousand gives 1 – (–1) = 2 thousand. We can now take the reciprocal and get 1 ÷ (–1) = –1, which is –1 thousand. The recorded value in dollars is then –1 × 1023.65 = –1,023.65. The actual difference in value in dollars is 2 – (–1) = 3. Therefore, the difference between the recorded and actual values in dollars is 1023.65 – (–1,023.65) = 3 thousand. Since the difference between the actual and recorded values is 2 thousand and the difference between the recorded and actual values in dollars is 3 thousand, the actual value is not divisible by 100,",

            "1020. The difference is 1023.65−1020 , which is equivalent to 3.65, but since this value is not even, it cannot be the recorded value of the property. Therefore, the recorded value of the property must be the largest even integer less than 3.65, which is 2. The actual value of the property is 1023.65−2 , which equals 1021.65. If 2 is recorded for the value of the property, this leaves a difference of 1021.65−1000.67 , which equals 21.98. Since 21.98 is not the largest possible difference (it may be even smaller since 1021.65 and 1000.67 may be approximations of the actual value of the property), let's round the recorded value of the property up to the nearest even integer (round up, rather than round down) to see if it would work. The recorded value of the property becomes 1022. It leaves a difference of 1023.65−1022 , which is 1.65. Since 1.65 is not an even integer, we must try another recorded value for the property. The recorded value of the property becomes 1022. This leaves a difference of 1023.65−1022 , which equals 1.65.  If we make the recorded value 1024, this would leave a difference of 1023.65−1024 , which is −0.35. Since this difference is negative, the recorded value of the property cannot be 1024. If we make the recorded value 1020 and we round this value down, we can get another difference of 1023.65−1020 , which is 3.65. But this is not even. However, since the property value is not between 1020 and 1022, the property value must be greater than 1022.

However, 1022.65 \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) 1023 is closer to 1023.65. But it is actually less than 1023. This happens because of the fact that a property should be recorded at the greater of the two values between the lower even number and the lower number two units greater than that even number. So the value for 1023.65 is actually 1024. The difference is 1024 - 1023.65 = 0.35, which is closest to 0.35.

If they had written a value greater than 1022, 1023 would be the greatest even integer less than or equal to the property value. In this case, the difference would be 1023 - 1022 = 1, but that also does not appear to be the answer choice. Therefore, perhaps the person meant to include 0 (indicating that the property was worth nothing). In this case, the value recorded would be 0, so the difference is 1023.65 - 0 = 1023.65, which again, is not an answer choice. Finally, if the person thought of the property to be worth the closest even integer less than 1023.65, the recorded value would be 1022, so the difference is 1023.65 - 1022 = 1.65. Now we see that none of these match answer choices, so we might conclude that there is no choice that matches the condition of the question. However, the error in the question makes this one of those questions that is easiest of all for our approach. Suppose you could only find 1024 as a value less than the actual value in the question. Then we can obtain a recorded value of 1023 since that is the largest even number that will satisfy the requirement. The difference in this instance will then be 1024 - 1023 = 1, again this does not match our answer choice. Now if we set the value of the actual value of the property to be the 1025 and then the recorded value will be 1024 since that is the even integer that is closest to 1025 and 1024 is the largest such even integer. In this case the difference between the actual and recorded values is 1025 - 1024 = 1. Still this does not appear to be the right answer choice, so our solution is not yet correct.

Let's now consider 1000 even by considering an additional even digit after the digits 1000. The next greatest even integer is 1002. Then we can try 1000 + 2; the next even integer is 1002. Now, let's continue this pattern of adding 2 with every integer. The integers being used are: 1000, 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, 1014, 1016, 1018, 1020, 1022.

When we use 1004 as the even integer we have a total of 2006, and if we add 1006 as the even integer we have 2008.  The total for 1008 would be 2010.

            " value and the recorded value is 1022 - 1023.65 = -1.65 Because we need to express the value in units of $100 to compare it with the other answer choices, we can express it as $100 and 63 cents: $1 and 63 cents - $1 = $100 and 63 cents - 2 = $100 - 2 cents , or -$2 dollars and 61 cents = -$2 dollars and 61 cents . To use the positive notation for dollars, we can express it as $2. The difference is $100.65 - $1023.65 = -$23.00 , so subtracting 1000 from both sides of the equation and adding 100 on both sides of the equation gives us 1023 - 1020 = 3 , or 1023 - 1020 + 3 = 3, which is exactly what we have on the left-hand side of the equation, and when solving the same equation 1023 + 100 - 1023 - 100 = 0 on the left hand side of the equation. Similarly, since there are two negative 2s on the left-hand side, we can add 2000 to both sides of the equation and then subtract 2000 from both sides of the equation, resulting in: \\( \\begin{array}{l}100+2000-2-2= 1020 \\ \\\\ 2000 - 1020 = 980 \\end{array} \\). Therefore, the difference between actual value and recorded value is $980 - $1023.65 = $43.35. However, if we subtract 3 from both sides of the original equation, we get the fraction (1022-1023)/1023 (3.65/1,023)=3/1023. Subtract 10 to (3/1023) subtract 10 (1022-1020)=$2 so we subtract 10 to get a fraction of 2/1023 = 2/1023, so 1022-1020 is 1022-1020=2 and 1022-1020=2 so we divide by 1023 to get 2/1023.\n",

Another  way to obtain this answer is to round up to 1023.00, and then choose the choice  around 1019.00 from the answer choices. Since 1019.00 is greater than 1.00, choice (A) can be eliminated. Choice (B) must be larger than 1.00. If it were less than .50, we could subtract .50 and try again to see if 1.00 works for a recorded value. Eliminate choice (E), because it must be less than 2.00, which means it would have to be below .50. If we  eliminated choice (B), that leaves us with choice (C) - If the property is valued at .62, then the amount of overvaluation is .62. Since none of the choices give answer of .62, we must multiply .62 by 100 to be able to use the possible answer choice of 1000. This will give us an answer of 62. , but 62 less than 1.00 is clearly too small, and 1000 does not make sense in this problem. A more realistic recorded value can be found by going through 100 possible integer values of $x$ that will make a recorded value that is evenly divisible by 100 with an actual value over 1.00 greater than the recorded value. If x was 1 then the recorded value would be $1001.00 and the overvaluation would be $1.00 which is less than .62 so continue trying different values for x",

The difference of 35.62 is the difference between 100.0 over 2 and 1.65. This can be reduced using basic arithmetic to get 100.0 over 2 - 1.65 = 50.0 over 12. The same difference of 50.0 over 12 between the actual and recorded value can be calculated from the values 1022.5 and 1021.5 as well as from the values 1023.5 and 1023.0. As a result, you can eliminate (C) as a possible answer.  The recorded value of 1022 is 2 greater than 1020. So it can be expressed as 1020 + 2. Likewise, 1023 is 3 more than 1020.

So, you can see that 1022, 1023, 1024, etc. are all greater than 1020 by 2, 3, 4, etc. In general, the recorded value can be written as 1020 + k, where k is an integer. Since the property value must be divisible by 100, the property value written as 1020 + k is also divisible by 100. In other words, 1020 + k is a multiple of 100. So, if k is an integer, 1020 + k is divisible by 100. This is true. For example, if k = 20, then 1020 + 20 = 1040 is divisible by 100. If k = 120, then 1020 + 120 = 1140 is also divisible by 100.

The actual value is approximately equal to 1 000 + 1.65. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 1.65. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is a rounding error. The actual value is approximately equal to 1 000 + 1.65. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 1 000 + 1.65, which is 1021.65. The actual value is 1023.65. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 1023.65 - 1021.65. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 2. The actual value is greater than the recorded value, so the rounding error is a positive number. The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is greater than 1. The actual value is closer to 1022 than to 1021. To get a difference of 1.65 between the actual value and the recorded value, the recorded value must be greater than 1.65 units lower than the actual value. In other words, the recorded value must be 2 less than the actual value; or, equivalently, the recorded value is less than 1.65 units greater than 1. The actual value must be less than the recorded value +1.65. To round down, a number is rounded to the nearest even integer. If the decimal portion of the number is greater than .5, round up. If the decimal portion is less than .5, round down. The recorded value is divisible by 100. So, the recorded value is 1020, or the recorded value is even and can round down to 1020. To round down, 1020.32 rounded to the nearest even integer is 1020. The recorded value must be 1022, or less than 1023",

The difference between the actual value and the recorded value is 1.65. The difference is not an even integer. Look for the smallest whole number less than 1.65, then determine whether this number is even or odd. If it's odd, add 1 and keep looking for the smallest whole number less than 1.65. If it's even, write it as is. 1 is odd. (1 + 1 = 2, which is even.) Now that you know it is 2, recall that 100 is even. This means you can add or subtract any multiple of 100 from the actual value of the property without changing the recorded value. However, a multiple of 100 will change the actual value, which must remain an integer. Add or subtract 100 to find a value with no remainder and test it as the recorded value. You can add and subtract 100, but keep adding, not subtracting, because the property is being recorded as greater than or equal to the property worth. Testing 1222 as the recorded value of the property: 1023.65 - 1222 = -199.35 Subtracting 100 will not yield a whole number, but 1 will do. This means that 1 is the recorded value.",

If the recorded value of 1022 was written on a piece of paper that was 1 cm x 2 cm, the actual value of 1023.65 is going to be written on a piece of paper that is 1.65 cm x 2 cm, since 1023.65 - 1022 = 1.65 and the difference in the area of a circle is given by A = πr^{2}. Then, the ratio of the difference in the area of 1.65 cm x 2 cm to 1 cm x 2 cm is the square of the ratio of the side length of the 1.65 cm x 2 cm circle to the side length of the 1 cm x 2 cm circle, or [(1.65/1)]^{2}.
