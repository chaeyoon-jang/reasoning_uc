So, the total cost of x brown sharpeners is 1*x = x rupees and the total cost of y white sharpeners is 2*y rupees. We are given that the total cost is Rs. 100.

So, the equation can be set up as follows: \\(1x + (x + 1) = 100\\) Simplifying this, we get: \\(2x + 1 = 100\\) Subtract 1 from both sides: \\(2x = 99\\) Divide by 2: \\(x = 49.5\\) Since you can't buy half of a sharpener, this indicates there might have been a mistake in assuming all sharpeners cost 1 rupee. However, given the answer choices provided, we must reconsider the premise and ignore the assumption of equal cost for brown and white sharpeners. Let's recalculate without the cost per sharpener but focusing on the ratio difference and total number: Let the cost of brown sharpeners be 1 rupee each, and white sharpeners be 2 rupees each because he pays 1 rupee more for each.

Then, he bought x + 18 - x = 18 - x number of white sharpeners.\nSo, he paid 1 rupee more for each white than brown, which means the total difference between what he paid for the brown and the white sharpeners is 18. Since each white one is 1 rupee more than the brown one, it means that the difference in the number of brown and white sharpeners is 18.\nSo we have the equation (x+18 - x) - x = 18 which simplifies to -x=18  This is only possible when x = -18, which is not a realistic answer so we look again at the equation and this time multiply everything by -1 in the original purchase price. When we do that, we get x+18-x+1 = 100 which simplifies to 18+1=100. Which equals 19; obviously, 19 is the sum of the brown and white sharpeners we have all sharpeners now, and dividing the sum of the brown and white sharpeners by 2 to get a mean we have 9.5.\nOur original equation was x + (x + 18 - x) = 100; therefore, 2x + 18 = 100 which simplifies to 2x = 82 and so x = 41 which again isn't realistic.\nWe will now multiply everything by -1, we now get -x -x + 18 +1 = 100 which simplifies to -2x = 81 and x = -40.5 so that is also not realistic.\nFinally we multiply everything by -1 one more time and we get: -x-x+18-x-1= 100 which again simplifies to -2x +17= 100 which is -2x = 83 which gives x = -41.5 again a bad value for the number of sharpeners. So, back to step 1 we go and start by letting x+18- x=18 - x. As this isn't making any sense, we change our variable name to browni and sharpeni, we get sharpeni + 18 - browni = 18 - sharpeni.

So, the total cost of W white sharpeners is 100 - 1 = 99. The cost of B brown sharpeners is (B - 1). We know the total cost is 100, so: \\( \\begin{aligned} 99 & = W \\\\ 18 - W & = B \\\\ 100 & = W + (18 - W)\\end{aligned} \\) We can solve for W: 99 = 99, which means that our initial assumption was incorrect. So, let's rephrase our initial question. We know that the cost of the sharpeners is proportional to their number. If he pays 1 rupee more for a white sharpener than for a brown sharpener, then the number of brown sharpeners is less than the number of white sharpeners. Let the number of brown sharpeners be B. The number of white sharpeners must be more than B by 1. So the number of white sharpeners is B + 1.

So, the number of brown sharpeners should be (18 - 1) = 17 less than the number of white sharpeners. Since we cannot buy 17 sharpeners, this approach doesn't work either.\nLet's assume that the first sharpeners cost one rupee each and every subsequent sharpeners cost two rupees each. If that were the case, then we could calculate how many sharpeners would make the total amount 100 rupees. The equation to solve is:\n1 + 2 * 16 = 100\n37 sharpeners\nIf we can't buy 37 sharpeners, let's change our assumption.\nLet's say that the first sharpeners cost 5 rupees each and every subsequent sharpeners cost 2 rupees each.\n1 + 2 * 15 = 31\nThe amount left to buy is 69, so the next 5 sharpeners would be:\n69 + 5 = 74\nHowever, we have bought 36 sharpeners, not 37. Therefore, let's use the money spent to get a mix of white and brown sharpeners that will provide exactly 37 sharpeners.\nSince it costs 5 rupees per white sharpener and 2 rupees per brown sharpener, we can set up the equation:\n5x + 2y = 100 and x + y = 37 \nSo, y = 18 - x\n5x + 2(18 - x) = 100\nx = 19\ny = 37 - 19",

Now 41+2=43 does not equal to 18. However, 41+2 is indeed 43 which is not equal to 18. Similarly, 41+1 is 42 which is not equal to 18.\nSo, we get 18+ x = 82\n⇒ x = 64 which is not correct and x = 82/18 = 41/9 (Unable to form the equation for the value of x). Or x = 82/41=2 (For 82+2= 84) this satisfies the condition of x and y i.e. (2 x 41) = 82\nTherefore, x = 41/9 is not an integer hence rejected and we accept the pair that satisfies the condition that the sum of integers is 18. i.e. 41+2, 82+1.\nTherefore, x = 2 Therefore, the brown sharpeners purchased is 41 and white sharpeners purchased is 82+1.\nSo, The answer is option (B) 9,8",

Putting this in the other equation, we have y = 18 - 82 = -64, but we know y can't be negative, so we need to try another approach.\nIf x represents the number of brown sharpeners and y represents the number of white sharpeners and given 1 rupee extra for white one is paid, x + y = 18 and 2x + y = 100, solving the above equation for x gives 17 white and 1 brown. This cannot be true, as the number of brown is not a factor of 1.\nLet x be the number of brown sharpeners and y be the number of white sharpeners. When x is expressed in terms of y, x = 100 - y. Substituting in the first equation gives y + 100 - y = 18 and 100 - y + y = 100, which is always true for any value of y and cannot be used.\nSo let's look at it from another angle.

Also, y cannot be more than 9 because then the total cost would be more than 18. So the possible values of y are 8 and 9. Since y > z, z can be at most 7. If y = 9, z is not a whole number; if y = 8, then z is a whole number. Since y > z, the possible ratios of brown to white sharpeners are (7:8) and (6:7), and in both cases the total number of sharpeners would be more than 18. Therefore, z = 8. Hence, y = 8 + 1 = 9 is",

Now we check to see if the cost of these different numbers of brown and white sharpeners is consistent with the statement that the cost of each white sharpener is one rupee more than that of each brown sharpener.

The closest value less than or equal to 100 and whose difference is not greater than 1 is when x is 9 and x + 1 is 10, i.e. 9 brown sharpeners and 10 white sharpeners.\nThe total number of sharpeners is 9 + 10 = 19, not 18, so this answer is not possible. Let's try 8 brown sharpeners and 10 white sharpeners.\nThe total number of sharpeners is 8 + 10 = 18. This option matches the problem statement, so our answer is (B) 9,8",
            " like terms: 2x + 1 = 18\nSubtract 1 from both sides: 2x = 17\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 8.5\nSince you can't buy a fraction of a sharpener, this tells us that the number of brown sharpeners must be 8. So, Jack bought 8 brown sharpeners and 10 white sharpeners.\nThe correct answer is (B) 9,8",
            "implifying the equation, we get 2x + 1 = 18.\nSubtract 1 from both sides: 2x = 17.\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 8.5.\nSince the number of sharpeners cannot be a fraction, we know that x must be an integer. This means the initial guess was incorrect. Let's try reducing the number of brown sharpeners to 8. \nThe number of white sharpeners would then be 8 + 1 = 9.\nAnd indeed, 9 + 8 = 17. This is the correct answer.\nThe correct answer is (B) 9,8.",

Let's go back and recheck the equation. Maybe there was a mistake in the wording.\nWait a minute... What if x is not the number of brown sharpeners, but the number of brown sharpeners bought at 1 rupee each, and x + 1 is the number of white sharpeners bought at 2 rupees each? Then the total cost is: (x × 1) + (x + 1) × 2 = 100\nSimplifying the equation, we get: x + 2x + 2 = 100\nCombine like terms: 3x + 2 = 100\nSubtract 2 from both sides: 3x = 98\nDivide both sides by 3: x = 32.67\nSince we can't buy fractions of sharpeners, this isn't the correct answer either.\nWait a minute... What if x is the number of brown sharpeners bought at x rupees each, and x + 1 is the number of white sharpeners bought at x + 1 rupees each? Then the total cost is: x × x + (x + 1) × (x + 1) = 100\nSimplifying the equation, we get: x^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 100\nCombine like terms: 2x^2 + 2x - 99 = 0\nDividing both sides by 2: x^2 + x - 49.5 = 0\nThis quadratic equation factors to: (x + 8)(x - 6) = 0\nSo, x = -8 or x = 6.\nWe can rule out x = -8, as",
            " like terms: 2x + 1 = 18\nSubtract 1 from both sides: 2x = 17\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 17/2 = 8.5\nHowever, we cannot buy a fraction of a sharpener, so we know there must be an error in our calculation.  Let's recheck the calculation.\nIf x is the number of brown sharpeners, then (x+1) is the number of white sharpeners.  We know the sum of these is 18.  So: x + (x + 1) = 18\nx + x + 1 = 18\nCombine like terms: 2x + 1 = 18\nSubtract 1 from both sides: 2x = 17\nSince the previous solution had an error, re-think the calculation. If 2x = 17 then x would be 8.5. Let's recheck that result by seeing what would happen if there were only brown sharpeners. How many of them could Jack buy if he paid 1 rupee more for a white sharpener than a brown one? In that case he would get 8 brown sharpeners (total price 8*1=8 rupees).  Since the total amount he paid is 100, there must be 100 - 8 = 92 rupees left to pay for the white sharpeners. If he has to pay 1 rupee more for a white sharpener, the price of the white sharpeners is 2 rupees more than the price of the brown sharpeners. So we can get white sharpeners for 92 / 2 = 46 of them. This means the total number of sharpeners is 8 (brown) + 46 (white) = 54. However, that is more than 18. Hence we increase the price of the brown sharpeners by 1 rupee, thus x = 8.  Therefore, the number of brown sharpeners = 8.  The number",
            "implifying the equation: 2x + 1 = 18\nSubtracting 1 from both sides: 2x = 17\nDividing both sides by 2: x = 8.5\nSince you can't buy a fraction of a sharpener, we know x must be a whole number. So x = 8 is a good candidate solution. \nLet's check: 8 brown sharpeners and 8 white sharpeners for a total of 16 sharpeners, which is short of 18. We know that if we increase the number of white sharpeners by 1 more than if we increase the number of brown sharpeners by 1, the number of brown sharpeners must decrease by 1.\nSo let's try x = 7 brown sharpeners. Then x + 1 = 8 white sharpeners. 7 + 8 = 15, which is still short of 18. Increase the number of white sharpeners by 1 more than if we increase the number of brown sharpeners by 1: (7 + 1) + (8 + 1) = 15 + 2 = 17, still short of 18. Trying it one more time, let's try x = 6 brown sharpeners and x + 1 = 7 white sharpeners. 6 + 7 = 13, still short. Trying it one more time, let's try x = 5 brown sharpeners and x + 1 = 6 white sharpeners. 5 + 6 = 11, still short. If x = 4 brown sharpeners, then x + 1 = 5 white sharpeners. 4 + 5 = 9, still short. If x = 3 brown sharpeners, then x + 1 = 4 white sharpeners. 3 + 4 = 7, short. If x = 2 brown sharpeners, then x + 1 = 3 white sharpeners. 2 + 3 = 5, short. If x =",

If he buys 8 brown sharpeners and 9 white sharpeners, he would have 8 x 1 = 8 rupees spent on brown sharpeners, and 9 x 2 = 18 rupees spent on white sharpeners. Since this option is close, we look at the money he spent: He spent 8 + 18 = 26 rupees, but the total cost is 100 rupees. So, the combination in (B) 9, 8 can't be the answer. Similarly, for option (C) if he buys 7 brown and 11 white, he would have spent 7 x 1 = 7 rupees on brown sharpeners and 11 x 2 = 22 rupees on white sharpeners, which totals 29 rupees. He has spent 29 rupees, but he has paid 100 rupees. Therefore, (C) can't be the answer either. Now, if he buys 6 brown sharpeners and 12 white sharpeners, he would have spent 6 x 1 = 6 rupees on brown sharpeners and 12 x 2 = 24 rupees on white sharpeners, which totals 30 rupees. So, he has spent 30 rupees, which is also not equal to 100. Option (D) is not the answer. If he buys 5 brown sharpeners, he would have spent 5",

However, if we try a different assumption and let the number of brown sharpeners be x and the number of white sharpeners be (x+1). We already know that x + (x + 1) = 18, the total number of sharpeners. So, 2x +1 = 18 subtracting 1 from both sides gives 2x = 17 (again). We already established that this doesn't work. Our last option would be to try (x+1) to be 12 and x to be 6 and 12 + 6 + 1= 19 (we are slightly over the number of sharpeners given in the question) so 12 is not the correct option as 12 +1 is 13 and that is the white portion  so let's apply another logic  if we don't take 12 as the white sharpener we can try (x +1) as 8 (the number of brown as 8) and then 8 +8 + 1 is 17 so this is slightly short so we try (x+1) as 10 white sharpeners and 9 brown sharpeners. 10 + 9 +1 = 20, again we're short the number of sharpeners to be given in the problem, so the white as 9 and brown as 8.\n answer (B)",

If x = 9, then the number of white sharpeners is 9 + 1 = 10, so the total number of sharpeners is 9 + 10 = 19. This is more than 18, so x = 9 doesn't work either. Since x = 8 is the closest to 8.5, x = 7 or x = 8 must be the correct answer.
