Here's the step-by-step process:1.  Adult fare: Given: The bus fare of one adult is Rs. 140.Fare of one adult = Rs. 140\n2. Child fare: Given: The bus fare of a child is half the fare of one adult. So, we calculate the fare of one child:  Children’s fare = 140 ÷ 2 = Rs. 70.Fare of one child = Rs. 70\n3. Total fare of 4 adults: Number of adults = 4\nTherefore, Total fare of 4 adults = 4 x 140 = Rs. 560Total fare of 4 adults = Rs. 560\n4. Total fare of 3 children: Number of children = 3\nTherefore, Total fare of 3 children = 3 x 70 = Rs. 210Total fare of 3 children = Rs. 210\n5. Total fare for 4 adults and 3 children = Total fare of 4 adults + Total fare of 3 children = 560 + 210 = Rs. 770Therefore, the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children between the same places is Rs. 770.",
