            " correct answer is (A).\n First, we can multiply 19 and x, then add 5, and subtract 15 and 7: 5 + 19x - 15 - 7 = 19x - 17. Next, we can evaluate the denominator (13 × 13) and 156: 13 × 13 = 169, so the denominator becomes 169 - 156 = 13. Now, let's put it all together: [5 + 19x - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = (19x - 17)/13, and multiply both sides by 13 to get: 13[(19x - 17)/13] = 13(19x - 17)/13. This is equivalent to the left side. So, the left side is equal to the right side, or 19x - 17.\n Since this value equals 6, the correct answer is x = (6 + 17)/19 = 23/19 = 1.2 or 23 ÷ 19 = 1.2 or .2(23). However, since that is not one of the choices, we know that we have to try each answer choice, so we have to take a closer look at (A). We know that 4(19) = 76, so if we substitute 4 for x in the equation, the left side of the equation is: (5 + 76 - 15 - 7) = 61, and this is greater than 6. Therefore, we can conclude that (A) is not the correct answer. Next, we know that (5.5)(19) = 105, so we should try 5.5. If we substitute 5.5 for x, we have: (5 + 105 - 15 - 7) = 78. This is greater than 6, so we can eliminate choice (D). Now that we have 5.5 out of 5, we are left with choice (B) as our only choice.\n Substituting 5.5 for x: [(5 + 19(5.5) - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = (5 + 10.5 - 15 - 7) [5 + 10.5 - 15 -",

[Step 2: Using inverses] It will be advantageous to remove the numbers in the denominator of the entire expression using the inverse operation - multiplication, since they are the number of repeating 13, and thus when multiplied by the inverse we get rid of the numbers altogether. The inverse of 13 is 1/13, so removing them will not change the whole number answer to the equation: Multiply the expression by 1/13 to get (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/[13 × 13 - 156] * 1/13 or = 1 + ? × 19/13 - 1 - 7/13 = (5 + ? × 19 - 8)/13 [Step 3: Now that we have removed the constants in the denominator, the variable's unknown is present only in the numerator.

In order to arrive at the correct answer, we'll first try to find the number (let it be x) that can be multiplied with 19 to get 5. Since 5 and 19 are both odd numbers, the number will also be odd. 19 - 19 = 0, which is an even number, but this value is 0. For x to be an odd number, it should be greater than 19 because 19 - 19 is 0, which is an even number. Since you cannot subtract two positive numbers and get 5 (an odd number), that can be the case when you divide 25 (which is 5 + 20) by 19, or the result will be 1.33, which is an approximate value. x, in this case, is 4.77. This value will be 4.75 as a result of (5 + 4.77 - 15 - 7).

The product is 169. It's easy to see that 169 minus 156 is 13, so now we have the expression as [? × 19 - 7]/13 = 6. Multiply both sides by 13 to cancel the 13 on the left side of the equation.

Begin by rewriting the problem in standard form (positive quantity over negative quantity). \\(\\frac{\\left(5+x \\times 19-15-7\\right)}{\\left(13 \\times 13-156\\right)}=6\\) Because there is a negative quantity over a negative quantity, rewrite this equation as a fraction with positive numerators and positive denominators: \\(\\frac{5+x \\times 19-15-7}{13 \\times 13-156}=-6\\) Multiply both sides of the equation by the absolute value of the denominator, which is \\(13 \\times 13-156=169-156=13\\), in order to clear fractions: \\(\\left|5+x \\times 19-15-7\\right|=-6 \\times 13\\) The absolute value of a quantity is simply that quantity without regard to whether it is positive or negative.

            " is [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6. We can start by solving the expression inside the outermost brackets first. Solving the expression, we have [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = 6 × (13 × 13 - 156). We can also rewrite the expression inside the brackets on the left-hand side as follows: 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 × (169 - 156). Now we can substitute the common term (169 - 156) and get the equation: 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 × 13. Now, we can solve for ? by multiplying 6 × 13 and combining like terms. The equation becomes: 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 78. We can combine the constant terms and move them to the right side of the equation: ? × 19 = 78 + 22. Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we have: ? × 19 = 100. We can divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?, which gives us: ? = 100/19 = 5.26 This can be approximated to 5.3, which is closest to one of the given choices. Therefore, the answer is 5.

This results in (19x - 17) = 6[(13 × 13) - 156]. Now multiply 13 × 13, which is 169, so the equation becomes (19x - 17) = 6(169 - 156). Next multiply 169 - 156, which is 13, so the equation becomes (19x - 17) = 6(13). Then multiply 6 × 13, which is 78, so the equation becomes (19x - 17) = 78. To isolate x, add 17 to both sides, which results in 19x = 78 + 17. Now add 78 + 17, which is 95, so the equation becomes 19x = 95. Finally, divide both sides by 19, which results in x = 95 ÷ 19.

            "5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6. First simplify the denominator on the left side: 13 × 13 = 169. So you have: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/(169 - 156) = 6. Now simplify the denominator further: 169 - 156 = 13. So, the equation simplifies to: [5 + ? × 19 - 22]/13 = 6. Next, distribute the 13 to the terms inside the brackets on the left side, effectively bringing the 22 inside the brackets as 22/13: [5 + 19? - 22]/13 = 6. Notice the fraction on the left side. 5 + 19? - 22 = 5 + 19(?) - 22: because (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. Here, a = 5, b = 19, c = 19, d = -22, so 19(?) = 19(+?) - 22.  To find the product of ? × 19, we can simply isolate that part, since the equation is already set equal to 6. To isolate the ? × 19, you need to get the terms containing 5 and -22 on the left side, by multiplying both sides by 13: (5 + 19?) - 22 = 6 × 13, (5 + 19?) - 22 = 78. Now, add 22 to both sides: (5 + 19?) = 100. This makes the equation, 5 + 19(?) = 100. Isolate the ? by subtracting 5 from both sides: 19(?) = 95. Finally, divide both sides by 19 to isolate ?: ? = 5.

            " as [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6 The first step is to simplify the brackets on the left side. Start with the 5 + ? × 19. There are 2 variables (× and ?) which means that there is an unknown number that is being multiplied by 19. First,  × means, so the number after ? is 5 + unknown number; so the expression becomes (5 + unknown number) × 19. Don't do any operation on 19 yet. Now work on the right side of the first bracket with - 15 - 7. These are subtracting 15 and 7, so the expression becomes - 15 + 7 = - 8. That means the expression becomes [5 + ? × 19 - 8]. Now go back to the left side and work on the 13 × 13 - 156. Multiplication of two numbers together means multiplying each one by the other. 13 × 13 is 169. Subtract 156. You want 169 - 156 which is 13. Now you can do 5 + ? × 19 which is 13 on the left side. Subtracting 13 from 13 is 0, and you are left with 0. So, the expression is [0 / 13] = 6. Anything divided by zero is undefined, so the problem must be incorrect. Choices (A), (B), (C), and (E) can be ruled out, leaving choice (D) as the correct answer. The only way to get the question off the table is to give ? a value for it, such as (D) 5.5. Thus, the final answer is (D).",

The next step is to get a common denominator on the left side. [5 - 22]/[169 - 156] = 6.\n -17]/13 = 6. The next step is to get 13 by itself on the right side of the equation. Therefore, divide both sides of the equation by 13 to get -17/13 = 6/13, or -17 = 6. [Note that we have gotten 13 on the left side of the equation.] Now multiply both sides by 13 to get 13(-17) = 6 × 13.\n Finally, multiply 13 and -17 to get -221 = 78.

If -17 = -20, then 13(-20) = 6 × 13. -260 = 78\nNope, this is not true, but this does not mean that it is not correct! The right side of the equation must also be negative if the left side is -17.

Add 15 and 7 to both sides to get all the constants on one side: 5 + ? × 19 = 78 + 15 + 7. Add the numbers on the right-hand side: 5 + ? × 19 = 100. Subtract 5 from both sides: ? × 19 = 95. Divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?: ? = 95 / 19. You can simplify the fraction to get ? = 5. The correct answer is (C).",
            " by 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 / [13 × 13 - 156] = 6\nFirst, simplify the numerator of the left side by combining the constants 15 and 7. 15 + 7 is equal to 22. Next, combine the constants 5 and 22 to get 27. (The other number being multiplied by 19 is represented by the question mark. This was 27.) You may want to set up the equation as 27 + ? × 19 - 22 / [13 × 13 - 156] = 6.\nThe next step is to multiply 13 and 13. Multiplying the two like numbers (13 × 13) results in 169. Next, we subtract 156 from 169. 156 minus 169 is equal to -13. We can now rewrite the equation to look like this: 27 + ? × 19 - 22 / (-13) = 6. Multiplying the numerator of the left side of the equation by -1 is the next step. Multiplying the fraction (-22) × (-1) equals 22. Next, add 22 to 27. 27 + 22 equals 49. Rewrite the equation to be 49 + ? × 19 / (-13) = 6. Then, change -13 to + 13 by multiplying the top and the bottom of the fraction by -1. When you multiply the fraction by -1, the -13 becomes + 13, and the top (22) becomes negative 22. You also have to multiply -1 * -1, which is +1. Rewrite the equation as 49 + ? × 19 / (13 × 1) = 6. Multiplying 13 and 1 results in 13. To avoid multiplying by 1, simply remove 13 × 1 from the fraction. Rewrite the equation to be 49 + ? × 19 / 13 = 6. \nNow, subtract 49 from both sides of the equation. This yields the following result: ? × 19 / 13 = -43. \nTo solve the remaining equation, you must isolate the only unknown number, ? that will satisfy the equation. Start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 13. This gets rid of the 13 denominator, producing ? × 19 = -559",

Let’s rewrite this equation to solve for ? using a calculator. First, solve [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = 13 by adding 15 + 7 to both sides to get [5 + ? × 19 = 13 + 22]. 13 + 22 is 35, so [5 + ? × 19 = 35]. 19 × 2 is 38, so ? × 19 is 35 - 5, which is 30. Divide 30 by 19 to get 1.5789473684210533, which rounds to 1.57895. Since the answer choice corresponding to 1.57895 is not 1.5 (which would be equal to 15/10), round 1.57895 to the nearest answer choice, which is 2, or more precisely, 2.

Since the answer choice corresponding to 1.85714 is not 2, pick option (C) instead, and try 2 + 1. Then, add 7 to the numerator to get 9. 13 ÷ 9 is 1.4444444444444445, which rounds to 1.44445, or 1.4449.  This corresponds to 2.3846153846153846, so pick option (D) and try 3.
