So, we need to find the original selling price for a 10% profit.\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\nOriginal Selling Price = CP + (10% of CP)\n= 23.54 + (0.1 × 23.54)\n= 23.54 + 2.354\n= 25.904\n\nNow, we know that 25.904 would be the original selling price for a 10% profit.\n\nThe new selling price is Rs. 25.75. To find the loss, we can subtract the new selling price from the original selling price:\n\nLoss = 25.904 - 25.75\n= 0.154\n\nThe loss is 0.154, which is 0.01054",
            ".50 and the profit is 10%, we can write:\n\n27.50 = CP + (0.1 × CP)\n27.50 = 1.1 × CP\nCP = 27.50 / 1.1\nCP = 25\n\nNow, if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75, we can use the same formula to find the profit or loss:\n\nSP = CP + Profit or SP = CP - Loss\n\nWe know that CP is Rs. 25 and SP is Rs. 25.75. Since SP is greater than CP, there is a profit.\n\nProfit = SP - CP\n= 25.75 - 25\n= 0.75\n\nNow, we can find the percentage profit:\n\nProfit % = (Profit / CP) × 100\n= (0.75 / 25) × 100\n= 3%\n\nTherefore, if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75, there would have been a 3% profit.",
            ".75 and the profit is 10% of the cost price, we can set up the equation:\n\n25.75 = CP + (10% of CP)\n\nTo find the cost price, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n\n25.75 = CP + (10/100)CP\n25.75 = CP + 0.1CP\n25.75 = 1.1CP\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.1 to solve for CP:\n\nCP = 25.75 / 1.1\nCP = 23.54\n\nNow, let's calculate the selling price if it were sold at a loss.\n\nThe given selling price for a 10% profit is Rs. 27.50. To find the cost price for this selling price, we can use the formula:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price + Profit\n\nSince the profit is 10%, the cost price can be found by dividing the selling price by 1.1:\n\nCost Price = 27.50 / 1.1\nCost Price = 25\n\nNow that we have the cost price and the new selling price, we can calculate the profit or loss.\n\nThe original profit was 10% of Rs. 23.54, which is:\nProfit = (10/100) x 23.54 = 2.354\n\nThe profit from selling the book at Rs. 25 for 10% of the cost price is:\nProfit = (10/100) x 25 = 2.50\n\nComparing the two profits, we can see that the book was sold at a smaller profit (2.50) compared to the original 2.354 profit.\n\nTo find the percentage of loss, subtract the smaller profit from the original profit, divide by the original profit, and multiply by 100:\n\n(2.354 - 2.50) / 2.354 ≈ -0.146 or -6.15%\n\nThe closest option is 2% Loss",
            ".50 and the profit is 10%, we can calculate the cost price as follows:\n\nCP = SP / (1 + (Profit Percentage/100))\nCP = 27.50 / (1 + 10/100)\nCP = 27.50 / 1.1\nCP = 25\n\nSo, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.\n\nNow, if it were sold for Rs. 25.75, we can calculate the loss as follows:\n\nLoss = SP - CP\n= 25.75 - 25\n= 0.75\n\nTo find the percentage loss, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage Loss = (Loss / CP) × 100\n= (0.75 / 25) × 100\n= 3%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 3% Loss.",
            ".75 and the profit is 10%, we can write:\n\nCP + 10% of CP = 25.75\n\nTo find 10% of CP, multiply CP by 0.10:\n\nCP + 0.10CP = 25.75\n1.10CP = 25.75\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.10 to find the value of CP:\n\nCP = 25.75 ÷ 1.10\nCP = 23.39\n\nNow that we have the cost price, we can calculate the percentage of profit and loss.\n\nWhen the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, which is less than the original cost price, there is a loss.\n\nLoss = Cost Price - Selling Price\n= 23.39 - 25.75\n= -2.36\n\nTo find the percentage loss, divide the loss by the cost price and multiply by 100:\n\n(-2.36 ÷ 23.39) x 100 ≈ -10.16%\n\nHowever, the closest answer choice to 10% loss is 10% loss, which is 10% but the -10% is given as option not 10%.\n\nHence, the correct answer is (D) 3% Loss",

            ".75 and the profit percentage is 10%, we can find the cost price.\n\nLet's say the cost price is x. Then, we can write the equation:\n\n25.75 = x + (10% of x)\n\nTo find 10% of x, we can multiply x by 0.1:\n\n25.75 = x + 0.1x\n25.75 = 1.1x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 1.1:\n\nx = 25.75 / 1.1\nx = 23.4\n\nSo, the cost price is Rs. 23.4.\n\nNow, we can find the selling price at a 2% loss:\n\nSelling price at 2% loss = Cost price - 2% of Cost price\n= 23.4 - (2% of 23.4)\n= 23.4 - (0.02 x 23.4)\n= 23.4 - 0.468\n= 22.932\n\nWe are given another option, which says if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75, then it would have been a percentage of loss.\n\n25.75 - 25.75 = - 0.75 = 0.75/25.75 * 100 % loss\n100 % = -3%\nSo, the book will be sold at 3% loss",

            ".10 x CP = 0.10CP\n\nNow, we can subtract 0.10CP from both sides of the equation:\n\n27.50 = CP - 0.10CP\n27.50 = 0.90CP\n\nTo find the cost price, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.90:\n\nCP = 27.50 / 0.90\nCP = 30.56\n\nNow, let's find the selling price if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75. To find the profit or loss, we can use the formula:\n\nProfit or Loss = SP - CP\n\nIn this case, the selling price is Rs. 25.75, and the cost price is Rs. 30.56. To find the profit or loss, we can subtract the cost price from the selling price:\n\nProfit or Loss = 25.75 - 30.56\nProfit or Loss = -4.81\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that there would be a loss. To find the percentage loss, we can divide the loss by the cost price and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage Loss = (-4.81 / 30.56) x 100\nPercentage Loss ≈ -15.7%\n\nSince we want to express the loss as a positive value, we can subtract the absolute value of the percentage loss from 100:\n\nPercentage Loss ≈ 100 - 15.7\nPercentage Loss ≈ 84.3%\n\nHowever, since the options don't include this value, we can round it down to the nearest whole number, which is 84% Loss. But the answer options are (A) 2% Profit and (B) 3% Profit, so we must use some other method. So, now we will recalculate the CP by use of the given data i.e. \nS.P = Rs 27.5 and Profit % = 10%\n CP = Rs (100 / 110)",
            "% = 0.10\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n27.50 = CP + 0.10 CP\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n27.50 = 1.10 CP\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.10:\n\nCP = 27.50 / 1.10\n\nCP = 25.00\n\nSo, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the selling price (SP2) if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75:\n\nSP2 = CP - Loss\n\nSince the cost price is Rs. 25.00, we can calculate the loss as:\n\nLoss = CP - SP2\n\n25.00 - 25.75 = -0.75\n\nSince the loss is a negative value, it means the selling price is less than the cost price. To find the percentage of loss, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage Loss = (Loss / CP) \\* 100\n\n(-0.75 / 25.00) \\* 100 = -3%\n\nSince the percentage is negative, it means the book is being sold at a loss of 3%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(D) 3% Loss",

A 10% profit on Rs. 25 and selling price is 27.50 doesn't hold true as it is a decrease of 1.75 in price.\n\nA decrease of Rs. 1.75 on 27.50 shows that a loss has occurred. Now let us assume the S.P. is 25.75\n\nNow we can calculate the CP:\n\nCP = (S.P × 100) / (100 + Profit percentage)\nCP = (275 × 100) / (100 + 10)\nCP = ",

Since the selling price (Rs. 25.75) is less than the cost price (Rs. 25.00), we know that there is a loss.\n\nTo find the percentage loss, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage Loss = ((Loss / Cost Price) × 100)\n\nLoss = Selling Price - Cost Price\nLoss = 25.75 - 25.00\nLoss = 0.75\n\nNow, divide the loss by the cost price and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage Loss = (0.75 / 25.00) × 100\nPercentage Loss = 3%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 3% Loss.",
